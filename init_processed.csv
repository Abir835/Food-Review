10,"Went there after referred by a friend. Tried their ""Cheese cream pasta"" and it was totally worth it. They have a variety of set meals and pizzas. NB: To all those who already owe a treat to their friends, trust me this is the best option you have!",Positive
12,"I went there for a family dinner . Had the set menu with BBQ chicken and naan, and believe me when I tell you I was utterly disgusted to my core as I've never had BBQ chicken or rather any food in any restaurant that bad. The chicken was bland as hell, tasted like a boiled piece of rubber and almost smelled bad . I don't know if they were having a bad day or something, but the most painful thing was it took them more than 1:30 hours to serve that 'Horror in a plate' .My parents had other set menu items which also included BBQ chicken that tasted almost as bad as mine. Though the staff behavior was good it doesn't make up for the bad food and the long wait. I don't know if my experience was an accident on their part or not but it sure was horrific .",Negative

80,It used to be one of my favorite places for food but my last three visits were absolute disappointment. The chickens were so dry and tasteless. My favorite charbroiled chicken totally lost its texture and top of that they reduced the size of the chicken pieces. Hope the management take these issues seriously.,Negative
82,"Quality and test of food is not great, also food is not well coordinated so you have to ended up paying high for a family dinner. Also they are not transparent when put advertisement as last week they put advert that there will be buy one get one free but didn’t mention time frame so when I reach they told that time is over.",Negative

100,"Great decoration, good service but when it comes to food it could be a lot better. Took the Jamaican chicken. It was a little too sweet for me. I took rice as a side and it was burned. When confronted they replied that it was supposed to have a smoky flavor!!!! I don't know what they meant!!! Anyways the chicken was well cooked, the Mocha according to my friend was also good. Rice was regular vegetable fried rice, nothing special. I have had better fried rice at street carts.... Seemed pretty expensive compared to the quality of food they serve. Good place to hangout with friends and family though. Cheers!!! ***Went their a week or two ago.",Negative

165,Very good interior decoration. good staff and services. Foods have different taste: Jamaican BBQ is really tasty though the Original BBQ is ok. Cream of mushroom is served in a round shaped bread; very tasty and has different looks. All other food are also well garnished and good in taste. Price is high. Front of the restaurant looks like a garage.,Positive
166,Simply it was really Good day With Good Food ....�������,Positive
167,Food very nice. They must concentrate more on their service during bit rush hours in areas like: 1. Serving glass when guests come. I had to call the waiter many times for water glasses. Upon calling they did their job. 2. Green salad portion can be increased a bit in quatity as per price.... 3. For a birthday celebration as booked earlier they should have arranged a small cake. All in all its good. Above points are just some personal comments.,Positive

175,"one of the best bbq, grills in town...love their their sehri / iftar meals... their food seem fresh... although I'd like to see a lil improvement on their mashed potatoe. it's a bit on the runny side... it's taste more like porridge than mashed potatoe, which should be a bit thick and dense... other than that, its worth it. i love their Jamaican and korean bbq meals �",Positive
176,Due to too much of pressure for the Iftar maybe the quality wasn't up to the mark at all. Prome fritte was too bad. Otherwise it was always pleasant to go BBQ.,Negative

If I knew that I have to eat this shit, I would have ordered the regular menu. It is absolutely cheating.",Negative
185,"Actually i don't usually write reviews because i am a serious critic and my level of criticism is way too high. But honestly i like your restaurant more than anything. Your Korean bbq, Jamaican bbq are amazing. Wherever i go, office, friends house, no matter i physically go to restaurant or not i order these food through foodpanda or my driver. I reside in uttara and i hope one day they will open branch here. 10/10 food quality.",Positive
186,"The food was good. Pasta was poor. But, the no of staff are very less. Can't manage. Don't visit there on Friday. There was almost none to check your requirements. Poor very poor.

191,"One should never order a pizza in this place. It was just below average standard. Home mades are far better than this. Code F 14: They attarct you by writing 20 pieces, but they don't tell you it's only a full chicken. Taka 1465 is not worthy of the plate at any standard of bd, may it be a chain shop. Code GC10: Jamaican chicken was good. Soup was good and had its signature mark with taste. Nice place but congested. ... Parking is a problem as usual. Security guards are eager for tips but has little idea of guiding a vehicle to park.",Negative

200,I've never had this franchise outside of Bangladesh. The food is good.I've been a few times and generally order the Jamaican Grill Chicken which is right and Mushroom soup to start. The ambience and decor is nice with dedicated areas for children's play and smokers balcony,Positive
201,"We tried four different pizza.all tasted almost same.no salt,no spice,thin crust.the chef should learn how to make pizza.the kiwi chiller just had syrup and sprite in it.not a single piece of kiwi was there.tastes was also not upto the mark. Overall sucks.not coming again.",Negative

208,everything we took tasted good.4 star for the price which is a bit high.,Positive
209,Well it is indeed one of my favourite restaurants in Dhaka because of the super tasty chicken and mushroom cream soup. But if I mention about the valentine platter particularly it was not really up to the mark! As it it suppose to be for two people but the rice given is not really enough for two people. Then there's this unnecessary � shaped sandwich! But yes if you talk about the chickens & the pricing comparing to other chicken platters then it was good to go!,Positive
210,Overall good place with quality food...we'll go again��,Positive
211,"Went to Gulshan Branch yesterday. I usually like their food but yesterday's service was the poorest! I didn't get 10% discount on SCB credit card though my bill was above TK. 3,000! Had to asked them couple of time to provide the promotional coupon. Very much disappointed!",Negative

215,It was buy one get one offer on pizza. Pizza was disaster. Worst pizza I have ever had .,Negative
216,"went at dinner tonight at dhanmondi branch....food was good but I have question about the manners & etiquette of waiters. While I was waiting for my guest after reserving the seats, they asked me rudely as if my guest are coming or not they have other reservation (have to mention that only half an hour passed after I took the seats and half the reserved seats are filled already!!!). After challenging them why they didn't take my reservation earlier when I called, they started... to say they wanted the seats because some ppl just came and ask for seat (I don't see those reservation ppl coming at all that night)....in between the conservation, one waiter said they did 30k per day business as if I give a damn shit about it (30k per day!!! seriously!!! as a brand like yours.......com'on man so poor!!!). After ordering the starter and 1st round of order, they seemed surprised to ask us that 5 person and only 4 dishes!!! REALLY THIS IS THE WAY YOU BEHAVE WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!

Without going into too much detail, 2 dishes can universally be recommended here, the pane mushroom soup and the korean charbroiled chicken.

I had an argument with the manager and was expecting something complimentary but he was also ""feeling dukkhito"" and said will consider me with good service next time as if I am a beggar to beg them for money or anything. I told them you all stole money and that's wrong and I don't live abroad so it does not matter whatever you do next time.

241,"I really like their food especially Jamaican chicken, korean charboiled chicken and pane mushroom soup. I go there atleast once a week. I recently went to the Dhanmondi branch and it was quite a let down compared to Gushan 2 branch. The soup wasn't creamy enough, the music was pretty loud etc etc. I much prefer the Gushan branch and I guess the chef here is the actual chef whose food made me fall in love with bbq!",Positive

248,"I went to Bailey road branch. The pizza is so poor i felt it was just robbery. The cheese was very thin and the bread was thin too. The topping was also very low in quantity. It felt like , i am having a ruti with some vaji :p The behaviour was good though and that's why i am giving 2 star. Never going to try again unless the food quality improves.",Negative
249,"Today we had the most awful experience at BbQ Dhanmondi branch. They have been offering the 50% discount on beverage and i liked their frappe everytime so went their tonight as it was the last night. And even though we had called at their number and verified that the store was open they denied to serve us the frappes! Not ony that, after providing us the menue the waiter was taking a while to come back. I found that the waiter and the manager was solving a dispute with ano...ther client. So called another younger waiter who was walking towards the table then the other waiter made him stop. He literally stoped him coming towards us and then he took another 5mins to solve the dispute.then this waiter and the manager had another chat, more like whispered in the years then they both came to tell they cannot serve the Frappe!!! They said they ran out of all ingredients! They literally didn't want to make the drinks as it was close to the closing time. They has an offer going on and it cannot be that they ran out of every single ingredients of all the drinks!! Even though we had said we didn't want anything else at all that being an International Chain they should be serving us they denied us completely!! I should also mention we went to the Dhanmondi branch just this friday night and the pizza was terrible too!!! It was nothing like the Gulshan branch pizza. Really really disappointed by this ignorant attitude and i doubt i will ever go back.",Negative

252,Soft drink 99+vat . :( It is too expensive. Others,Negative
253,"Okay, here's an honest review. Went to the Dhanmondi Branch yesterday and the food was okay. It was nothing completely out of the ordinary and that would have been completely alright had the items not been priced premium. The service was absolutely horrible! I mean how are you guys still in business with the current lot of waiters? A waiter literally tried to force an item on us by repeatedly insisting in the rudest of manners and the most annoyed of expressions. We had to ca...ll the waiters multiple times before any of them responded, every time. No, they weren't busy, just standing at the nearest tissues counter (or something) doing absolutely nothing. It took them about 15 minutes to get the bill and another 15 to return the change. The music was too loud and they did not turn down the volume even after we requested them to. Please take note that we have not been rude to any of the servers even once through out the whole process. Now, considering the fact that the Dhanmondi branch is a relatively new outlet, the cutlery items used should still be in relatively good condition but they were not. Most of the spoons had so many scratch marks on them that it almost gave the feeling that we had been provided with used utensils from the older branches. Does not reflect the class BBQ BD claims to boast. Not a good experience overall. Not sure if I wanna go back there, not anytime soon at least. P.S.- Can provide pictures if necessary.",Negative
254,Good food and service..the employees were gentle as well...will love to visit more...,Positive
255,"Bbq Bangladesh Dhanmondi Branch is a big disappointment, Menu card's price of each item really differs with the price of the bill,I have tried your Gulshan branch for almost 6-7times and I loved it, no complains from there.. And 2times at your dhanmondi branch.. My experience was bad both the times there.dhanmondi branch serves completely different quality of food, it's too bad , the quantity of your pane cream soup was very low.. Taste of chicken was bad and served cold. The... second time I went there, the taste of the food was average and I clearly remember that I ordered food costing around 1500 -1600tk on the menu card( Korean Charboiled chicken 3pcs chicken, 1 piece jamaican chicken meal with mashed potatoes and 3 cocacolas). They charged me the double on their bill around 3000tk. I have calculated on my own and it would have been around 1800tk-2000tk with vat and service charge. This was a clear fraud.. This might also be an inside fraud between the manager and the waiters so the authority must take this into consideration.I am never going back to bbq bangladesh again. This was not only me who faced such a problem but also I know few more people disappointed with Bbq Bangladesh dhanmondi's bill problem.",Negative
256,Ate iftar platter. Grilled jamaican chicken was good. But fried rice was terrible. Smell of olive oil ruined the salad.,Negative
257,"Ripping people off basically. Please kindly take business seriously if not passionately. The management is very poor and the description of their items is not true to its words.

268,"I ordered Golden Olive Value Meal but I cudnt find anything valuable! Whatever , this combo contains 1pc golden olive chicken ,fried cajun wedge potato, veg rice, egg n salad! At first , they forgot using salt probably :) 1) so far I know with my little knowledge, olive chicken is prepared using olive oil to fry the whole chicken n mixed up with some spices .I neither found any spice nor olive taste. 2) veg rice - hardly got vegetable, dried up rice , less quantity 3) egg ...: even an egg can taste this much worse , I didn't know , forgot using salt here also, as mentioned. 4) potato: the only thing I cud eat at least. Overall experience was worst, this dish costs 345 including Vat.I never hesitate spending if the quality and taste are satisfactory, but this place was irritating enough",Negative

I was served cold food, even the mushroom soup was barely warm. And something is wrong with your mashed potato, it is usually so yummy (in Gulshan branch) but in my last two visits in dhanmondi branch I was disappointed with it too (may be the chef here is not getting the recipe right) Anyway, I really hope you guys were just having a bad day, but please make sure this doesn't happen again...COLD food is just not acceptable. I look forward to visit you many more times, please don't ruin the place for me. Thank you",Positive

Also their hospitality was A class, all of their staffs are well mannered. Also the interior is pretty much impressive. Price might seem a bit high comparing to others those serving traditional Indian food, but the quantity is well enough. They say the Indian dishes are single serving, but it seemed a bit much for a person to me. Next time I want to try their Chinese cuisine. Hope it will not be a disappointing one. P.S. Though15% service charge and VAT was not included with the price in their menu, for some reason it was not charged to me.",Positive

Specially I always appreciate Saim's service, who recently got promoted to branch manager. He has always pleased us a lot. Congratulations to him for his success, the staff working under him are also pretty good, Saim is managing his branch pretty well. Today Nahid's service also pleased us.

786,"I always loved the food of Hakka Dhaka as I was visiting you from the very beginning I guess. But today for ones I thought of rating you 4 instead of 5. Reason: I always liked your food because it was a different chinese. Hot & spicy. But today, (I visited you almost after an year) i didn’t get that spicy chinese.(specially the Mongolian beef). We can have Chinese in many other restaurants. But the taste you provided was incomparable to us. However, the food was good and the service was too good as always.",Positive

864,If possible I would give it a zero. The dhanmondi branch waiters are fraud. Me and my friend took two happy meal to eat and two for parcel. They gave us smelly leftover chicken i guess. They literally lied to us that two plates will get only one kulfi so they cut the kulfi into pieces and served us. For the two parcels they said they cannot give drinks or kulfi instead they would give only one yoghurt. They literally seemed like they didn't wanted to serve us..why?? Because there was no guy with us??...even after inquiring several times they just cheated us by not serving what we paid for.....such theif waiters in a restaurant like hakka dhaka seriously?? Worst behaviour and experience!!,Negative

869,Hakka- fusion of indian and chinese cuisine... And perhaps hakka dhaka is the most famous for serving hakka cuisine.... Orders their seafood platter and platter B... Wrapped prawn was certainly their blockbuster item and wantons played the Xavi role.... rice was decent but hakka noodles were bullshit... those were like noodles sold on carts! bbq crab should win the ballon d' or while steamed fish was may be the neymar of the platter! squid seemed to be paul pogba- overrated... chicken cashewnut was very good so the Szechuan prawns!!!,Positive
870,"Yesterday we had the Happy Meal for Tk 499 and it was a very satisfying lunch. The spicy taste is what I liked most and the quantity was sufficient. The kulfi was excellent. We also ordered the Seafood Platter for 4 for takeaway. When we sat down to eat we found there wasn't enough food for all 4 of us. The fried rice, noodles, wrapped prawns and whole baked fish was sufficient but there wasn't enough crab and squid. After I called and complained to the Manager, he sent complementary dishes of each. I am impressed by his prompt action and good customer service. happy to see such professionalism. Keep up the good work!",Positive

886,"Me and some of my friends had iftar here yesterday. First, I called up Hakka Dhaka Banani to make a reservation and they didn't answer my phone 5 times until someone picked up and hung up on me before I could even hear them! Then they started declining my calls after I called them again! (How rude!) I called them again with my home telephone line... And someone finally picked up and took the reservation. Unfortunately, all the tables inside were reserved and we had to sit ...outside. It's not that special outside... doesn't have a nice view or anything... just a bunch of plants to block the horrid view. And the people that usually sit there are smokers who have their iftar with a cigarette. My main problem was the noise outside. Cars were honking outside and it ruined the entire experience. My suggestion is that they should just convert that place into an indoor area. The food was alright... But a bit overpriced. The Ramadan platter was 4K for 4 people. I think for that amount, they could've thrown in some extra dishes. The noodles was just average... Everyone kept saying it was ""cocola noodles"" I hope they take notes and improve.",Negative
887,"Great food! Loved the Ramadan platter. Service was good too (but needs improvement in certain areas). Overall, had a great time there with my friends and would recommend the place to anyone for a good iftar party with friends!",Positive
888,I wish I can give negative marking.. Was my first time yesterday for iftar... But their way of serving food for iftar is very disappointing. When you fasting your food must be on your table so that you can eat/ate according your choice rather than you just wait for food for their serving. Exactly that was happen for every customer yesterday. Another thing iftar platter for 4 Person was 4000 bdt and I was asking myself why I paid for these kind of food.. The items all were spicy and hot that you couldn't differentiate the taste. And quantity of food was not anyone's desired....,Negative

903,Spicy & Tasty food................................!!!,Positive
904,Hmm the food is good... Specially the platters has enough variety. I think good food is a good investment so my investment was successful.,Positive
905,This was my first time yesterday. Starters were great. The main course was dissapointing really for the set platter....chicken was in the refrigerator for too long.....the noodle wrapped prawn (the one I wanted to taste) was bland.... (can spice up the prawn a bit).The prawn veggie was good and so was the beef. Most dissapointing thing was that they don't keep soft drinks at normal temperature (wierd)....come on there are children!! The best thing about the restaurant are the waiters who are helpful but a bit helpless given the circumstances!!!,Negative
906,Starters are most delicious. Also I liked kulfi. Good service.,Positive

Noddle wrapped shrimp and honey barbecued chicken wings were great appetizer. Wonton and dumplings were also very tasty. ... Noddles and Mongolian chili beef are a bit spicy, not for kids.

934,"Me and my wife went there on Baishakhi afternoon to take there Favorite meal (tk 499) meal platter during odd time. The platter was offered from 4.30 pm to 6.30 pm and we delayed our lunch just to have a taste of it. We thought to take the alternate options in our two platters so that we could have a chance to taste all the options. But when we went to order, the parser refused to give alternate options and replied that they do not take order for single platter. Even he repli...ed that if we ordered for single platter than they would refuse to serve so but it was not mentioned in anywhere in their flyer. The attitude of the parser was unfriendly. However we placed order. Then the manager came and roughly asked whats my problem. When i explained to him the issue, he became somewhat soft and said sorry. The food came. The rice and spaghetti became normal temperature and did not taste well. The mongolian beef and wrapped shrimp was good. Chicken mushroom was average. The special kulfi was good but not that much special... Overall FOOD was different, taste would be better if served hot, has areas of improvement.. Restaurant atmosphere and cleanliness was better.. But SERVICE is poor, promotional offers should be carefully designed, and the servers and managers should learn how to stay polite when they are in the wrong side of any debate... However I will go there/order online another day to get the taste of other items...",Negative

972,Food is awesome.. truly delicious! A Heaven for people who love hot n spicy Chinese food! Service is not up to the mark. AC does not work well. Restaurant stuffs delay in serving food specially when we order Platter items. They serve some of the main items after serving the starters of a platter so lengthy that the customers finish having starters when they still keep bringing some 1 or 2 items which makes difficult for the customers to complete whole meal! Doesn't makes sense!!! Stuffs need to be trained about time management well to make dining meaningful!!!,Negative

990,"Best Chinese food I have ever taste,really loved the food. Their environment is great and the service is also amazing.

Otherwise they are the best,so 5*.�",Positive
991,"The Hakka Chinese is mouth watering! Each dish made us feel droll. The smokey flavors of fried rice and noodles was very much appealing. Ambience was good, but the problem of mosquitoes is a little acute though delicious foods over - scored it! We noticed a good food serving and welcoming behaviour in Hakka Dhaka, but a bit more personal hygienic attitude was expected from the waiters. Overall, it's a geeat restaurant for foodies, a must visit place!",Positive

1014,"Amazing place & great hakka Chinese. Most importantly I liked the platter of joy, which was introduced recently. Its a great deal for 2/4. One thing definitely can be improved, is the sound management of the restaurant, as when it becomes too much crowdy, noise of talking starts to reflect & gets irritated. Service of the waiters can also be made more classy. Above all Food was delicious, so I would love to visit again & again.",Positive
1015,Ordered the PLATTER-B worth of 1300 for 2 person.. And here's what i think 1) Rock-hard beef. I know it was supposed to be dry but it's definitely not supposed to be harder than my teeth. 2) The szechuan prawn supposed to have an spicy red saucy texture. But here it's full of red grease. Looks like it came out of an old truck's engine. 3) The chicken with mushroom was okay but full of onions. Onions everywhere. 4) The dough of the dumpling was crunchy and brown. It was more like shingara. 5) The noodle was greasy and over-spicy 6) And that one star is for the fried rice which was decent.,Negative

We were 11 people went to have lunch and picked your 299 set menu offer (circulated in your FB page). You had different options in the set like rice/noodles, beef/chicken etc. but the first thing you said everybody has to choose one item! why?? if so then why did you keep the options?? And later you denied 10% discount on women's day celebration which is clearly mentioned in your page. Very disappointing! These days people do talk/share. So you should be very cautious about it.

1072,"I have been a regular at Hakka Dhaka ever since the very start of their venture with their small restaurant at Banani. Ever since the very beginning they realized the fact that they might be the ""under-dog"" of the industry which motivated them to provide the most superior value possible which kept me coming back time and again, but this favorite restaurant of mine disappointed me quite a bit the past couple of my visits. I believe that in order to maximize the value provided... to the customers, a good service is as crucial as good food. Even though their food remains to be fantastic, it's their service that continues to frustrate me. It really pains me to say this as one of the owners is a good acquaintance of mine but even though the management is absolutely top notch, their service providers (a.k.a. Waiters) has some of the most unsophisticated and un-professional attitude and this just keeps getting worse. It is not always possible for the management to engage the customers directly, hence it is these waiters who end up being the face of the restaurant and it is not a pretty face. Please do not take it as a sign of aggression but rather a constructive criticism from a fan of the place. I am posting this here instead of a third party forum (such as foodbank) in the hope that the management takes notice of this issue. Apologies for the rant. Regards, Faiz.",Negative

The wings, crispy beef and prawns in particular, insanely good. And to go with it the pricing is reasonable. If the owners manage to keep the quality consistent and continue to give personal attention to customers, then Hakka Dhaka is definitely going places.",Positive

We the employees of Dmoney and Square Group wish to pay the bill with Dmoney Account instantly. Cash transaction is too much main stream & hazard full to us. Best wishes from Zaman, Dmoney Bangladesh Ltd.",Positive
1197,"Food test is very bad, if that food would have been in a small restaurant no body said good words about that but as it has a fancy name that's why (may b) people say many many good words. it is the most worst food they serve, total bill was 1272 tk.",Negative
1199,Food was good . Bt if your upper floor is pre booked then say it to your customers before they sit there . It’s kind of annoying that after placing order you will came and told that place is reserved! You should’ve say that earlier.Hopefully next time we won’t have to face that situation ☺️,Negative

1202,"The Sirloin Steak Bento was good. It has few other items like chicken wings, Prawn spring Roll, Fried Prawn. Taste of steak was just OK, nothing to say ""wow"". Mashed potato was too soft. However it is a good deal to share between Two. Their potato wedges is very good.",Positive
1203,"Didn't have a good experience at all. The foods and services are no value for money, not even half. The worst part was, we found hair in one of the chickens",Negative
1204,"I think they have the worst service ever. They have no generator. So when the electricity goes down, they can't provide you any fried food. Moreover, they can't even provide you extra fans. But their food is really good. So if you only care for quality food, then it's worth a try.",Negative

1207,"Shitty service! no lie.. the scheme is to rob customers off with overpriced juices and not even an option for soft drinks, on top of that water temperature is normal.

1210,I just hated this place and regretted why I wasted my weekend dinner by going there. The food was so spicy that none of us could even eat. When I asked the manager why the food was done spicy without asking us in Advence they have replied that their food taste like this. So if the food is like this I don't want to visit this Resturant even again.,Negative
1211,"I went there yesterday with my friends. We ordered Chicken steak with fried rice and beef steak also. It was awesome in one words. I think, i ate one of the best steak in dhaka City. They served nicely and did not take long time to serve. But negative thing is that they have no sufficient soft drinks so that it was very tough to choice one for drinking. Anyway though food was little bit costly but taste was good so that anybody should consider that cost!!",Positive

1265,"I found it to be consistent. Went there on 25/2/17. It was probably my 3rd or 4th visit and the food quality remained good like before. Their chicken steak is something I crave for every single day. I tried their platter 'Epic Romance' and the chicken steak and the jumbo prawns were definitely highlight of the dish. The wedges were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and the cheesy rice complimented the dish pretty well. I would also suggest their beef bento and their lemon chicken meal. Those are really good too.",Positive

1276,They didn't take Amex card. Got really embarrassing after we were done eating and I didn't have cash to pay the bill. I had to call a friend and ask him to send money via Bkash and wait for 30 minutes for the transfer to happen. They didn't even have bank transfer facility to make things easy. Very bad experience on that end. Food was good though.,Negative
1277,"Love the place, the aesthetics, the food, and the service. In any aspect, one critical factor is style and originality; Treehouse has an abundance of it Ideal if you want to take someone out for a great meal and a meaningful conversation; the place itself is a great conversation starter Not ideal at all of you wanna skip class and go there for some ""hanky-panky"". You better stick to Argeela for it Be ready to spend about 1k-2k per person",Positive
1278,The restaurant is okay. The decor is decent. The stairs are totally unsafe. The menu... it has a lot of flaws. Starting with the lack of fizzy drinks to not being able to order extra sides. Not everyone wants to drink juice with a steak. I know I don't. I had to get those mini water bottles you all have that taste extremely bitter. Try to get Mum and some other mineral water brands since getting water is the only option for people who don't want those juices. Also what am I s...upposed to do if I want extra wedges? Order an entire lemon chicken platter for those 5 pieces of wedges that come with it? The menu is extremely inconvenient. The platters were decorated okay. Looked aesthetically pleasing. The wedges were the only decent sides. The rice was somewhat okay too. The mashed potato and mushrooms weren't up to the mark. I had expectations from this place and I am disappointed.,Negative

1280,"I and my wife went to Tree House yesterday. We ordered the bento box of beef steak. The taste of all the elements of bento box was very good. It was definitely pricey compare to the quantity which wasn't even enough for 2 persons. We had one watermelon drink and our bill came down to around Tk.1620.00. After paying that bill, we couldn't fully satisfy our hunger. The service and presentation were okay.",Negative

1308,Definitely a bit pricey but the food was worth it. Liked the ambience of the 2nd floor but not the 1st. 1st floor seemed to be very stuffy even on a rainy day. Maybe another AC could fix that? Ordered a beef bento as well as a chicken steak. Loved every bit of the food other than the veggies (this might be a personal preference). Had a great time. Thank you! ^_^,Positive
1309,"I went with a huge of hope. Lemon Chicken was just off bone drumstick of chicken, but not juice or burnt. Its a mild taste. I order chicken steak too, chicken with breast skin wasn't cooked perfectly. but potato wedges, salad was too good. Drinks price is HIGH",Negative
1310,"After a long time, wish to visit a restaurant again. Tree House: I was feeling disappointed when I was entering in the place. The place is really very small but food and ambience was good. We tried Beef Bento Box (1089tk) and Lemon Chicken (530tk) and Thai Papaya Juice (150tk). VAT applicable. Taste: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Price: 3.5/5",Positive
1311,"food was quite ok but menu is too short. Didn't get the point why don't they serve soft drinks when their juice aren't up to the mark. & the rest room, my goodness, it was overflowing. I was so shocked.",Negative

1315,"Though the ambience of the restaurant was good but the food which matters the most let the restaurant down. I had the beef bento. The steak was over cooked, mashed potato was horrible (which almost made me puke) and I didn't like the mushroom as well. To me the buffalo wings lacked flavours. The only good things in the platter were the prawns and the salad. Again I had their pineapple juice which was way too grainy. They really needs to improve.",Negative
1316,"yes good food..i liks all foods,,,thanks tree house...",Positive
1317,"We went to tree house and ordered the chicken steak meal however, I could hardly taste the flavours as the heat of the spice took over! Good service but if the food is going to be really hot, it should be stated on the menu.",Negative

1326,You people made our day. Thank you for all your supports. Wonderful decoration and super tasty food and peaceful place. Just totally loved it. Spend one of the best days of my life till now.,Positive
1327,"I had visited this place before, and the first time was satisfactory and for the price, they have a standard and likable menu. But as I'm writing this now there's a notable callousness from their part which can be something anyone is likely to face trouble with. I have had dinner with my family yesterday and took three of their current iftar platters alongside one sea food platter from their usual menu. The food was nothing special but it didn't lack taste either. The icecrea...m that was with the iftar platter was melted though. However, the issue that occured is when we were provided with the bill, the sea food platter stated 1597tk (vat excl.) This was startling for us as in all their menues it had 597tk written on it. When heading out we pointed it out and they merely apologised. My concern is that it is a restaurant's responsibility to correctly and accurately list down information of every item. The customers decide on a menu weighting down on both the price and food combined, an error such as this does not only put the customers at inconvenience but is mainly very misleading.",Negative
1328,"Just had iftar and alhamdulillah, foods are delicious. I really like the service, despite getting into the last moment of azan, our sit was still reserved :)",Positive
1329,"Everything is too good... food, staffs, presentation... :)",Positive

1339,"A splendid place to hang out with the dearest ones. Food is delicious, and I personally recommend everyone to try the Buffalo Wings, those are too tasty. Service was good, and it's really nice that they only serve food and beverage of their own, they even don't sell coke or any other beverages. Instead, you can go for their organic juices, which I liked a lot. Finally, this place is worth of giving a try.",Positive
1340,LOVED the food! The service was also great! And the tracks that were playing were my favorites so it was a bonus for me xD Great place and will visit again!,Positive

1350,"This is regarding dining experience at Tree House last night(18th September 2015).I am disappointed that I could not see through the reviews before agreeing to go for dinner with friends and a one year four month old.We waited one and half hours for 3 chicken steak meals and 1 beef steak meal(there was just three options to choose from).I personally feel pricing should include the 'experience' and interior for dining out,if that is so,the pricing is high because the place is ...really really really congested.There was this loud group of boys celebrating a birthday or something,but as common sense is most uncommon these days,the small space did not affect them to share incidents about their lives as loudly as possible.The staff maybe well behaved but the waiting time for food was so dispiriting(food was served as soon as we got up to leave) that there are no pictures to share.Also, if the food was extremely exciting that would have been a totally different story.Anyway,maybe it was a bad day for me or maybe my expectations do not match the common good reviews about this place,I will never frequent this place again.",Negative

They didn't have the ingredients for making Pizza like meatball, tandoori chicken etc. So we had to order BBQ chicken & Americano Di Pepparoni . Taste was ewwww... Yeah I know.. Taste depends on each person. কিন্তু আমরা ৪ জন ছিলাম, এবং কেউই খেতে পারি নাই।। বাদ্ধ্য হয়ে sauce , mayonnaise and pepper দিয়ে কোনো ভাবে গিলে এসেছি ।। Interior এর অবস্থা কমেন্ট এ দিচ্ছি। সামনে পেপ্সি , মিরিন্ডার বোতল রেখে আলাদা গ্লাসে serve করে ২৫ টাকা রাখার মানে বুঝলাম না!!!!!!!!",Negative

1465,"In a city of bricks and concretes, yesterday I chose to be at a place like ""Triangle cafe"" for Iftar. The place is situated just beside 3/a Dhanmondi lake, if you're a nature lover like me then its the perfect place for enjoying the soothing weather and gentle breeze of this monsoon. Triangle had two platers, one with a rice bowl and the other offering chowmein. Being a chowmein lover I ordered plater 2 and I have to agree the food was great in quality and sufficient in quantity for one. The BBQ chicken is a must try and also the kebab roll was juicy and spicy. The chowmein tasted perfectly seasoned. Both the platers are priced 450/- BDT all inclusive. I will recommend everyone who is looking for an escape out of this city sensationalism, Triangle is your place to feel the nature and enjoy a quality time with mouthwatering food.",Positive
1466,"A small cafe which is only accessible through a lakeside walkway in this city of concrete. Very nice place to chill and hangout with friends remaining close to nature. Try their grilled mushroom (ask to make it spicy), boti kebab and/or wraps. Their khichuri is pretty good as well. Chillers/shakes are must try!! Cheers!!",Positive
1467,"Very nice place to hangout with friends and family cause it is very close to our nature and far away from concrete life. after having our iftar, fortunately we were witness of a heavy rainfall and that was amazing experience.

So, there is a room for improvement. Ambiance, Environment & service- 5/5 without second thought. So, overall a happy customer :)",Positive
1471,The environment is good. Their food is very delicious and their service is excellent. Had their Nachos which is very good and I found it best when compared with other Nachos. Platters are excellent as well. Their buffalo wings and Nachos are must try. Reasonable price along with good quality and quantity of foods.,Positive
1472,"Seeing the location felt good about the cafe but they were renovating so very few customers which is why asked if they will be able to serve and the staff replied yes. To our surprise they served old and smelly chicken in their BBQ set menu to both of my colleagues and burnt mushroom to me one by one with serving the third meal 40 mind after ordering. Upon complaining they discounted 37 or 47 taka from the bill silently, which only shows they knew what they were serving and still went along with it. Very disappointing. Won't visit again and will suggest my Peers to do the same.",Negative
1473,Environment is too good for hanging out with friends and loved one. Food quality and quantity is just perfect according to the price. I guess they have the Best Nachos in town according to Price and quantity. Their mushroom items are must try too. Will definitely refer to try them again.,Positive
1474,Very bad behavior. We asked for a mineral water and they gave us a local brand (ps:never heard of that company) . The cap was broken and expire date was removed. But they claimed that we broke the cap. We returned the water bottle. Then they immediately gave us the bill. We didn't even ask for the bill.,Negative

We ordered kacchi platter (5 persons) including chicken roast, beef tikka, firni, jarda and borhani. When the dishes came we discovered that there was no mutton in the kacchi!!! When called, the waiter told that it was a mistake and brought all the muttons together in a seperate bowl. Two pieces of mutton for each person and the pieces were very tiny. the firni was like baby food (semolina) and there was no raisin in it. Jarda was of no difference. Above all, the food quality was nowhere near the quality of the one in Rampura. only there ambience and the borhani compelled me to put a 2 star. otherwise I would have given a one.",Negative

I explained it's the meal that I ordered. He was going back and forth... He seemed confused. I told a trainee standing next to him to ...call someone senior, the manager so that I can explain. She told the cashier instead. And he got agitated. He showed the fries pack and started saying you ordered 2 pcs chicken. The guy standing to him stepped in and took my order. He remained silent as he exchanged the cards... no thanks or apology for the confusion... nothing. To make it worse... he came upstairs after a while to clean up and kept exchanging eye contact couple of times. Don't want to put his name in public. Would be happy to inbox.",Negative

And surely, I would love to visit them again and again.",Positive
2194,"Went there last Friday with my friend, got surprised a bit seeing such a small place. Upon arrival they waiter attended us with details of their menu as they prepare steaks in two types of Texas style with some deviations. We selected a Sirloin and Tomahawk, which were 300g and 500g. The truth is we were a bit skeptic about the weight they were mentioning but to our surprise they showed us the raw steaks that they were about to prepare for us. This was a nice touch. Liked the... way they ask customers approval for the cuts before preparing it as they were doing it for all the guests in other tables too. After waiting for around 30 mins, the steaks arrived. We ordered medium done and medium rare the steaks were exactly like we ordered. The medium rare Tomahawk tasted even better than my medium done Sirloin. Both the steaks had sof juicy center with flavorful seared crusts. Loved every bite of the tender steak till the end. The portion is quite hefty along with the sides of mashed potato and sautee vegetables. The sauces were nice compliment to the steak, would recommend their roast bacon glace for sure. This will be my steak place from now on for as long as they serve steaks like that.",Positive
2197,"One of the best steak I ever had in Dhaka. Done and Texture was perfect. Price is high, so is the size, 300 grams to fill your tum and tastebud. Mashed potato was great.",Positive
2199,"First glimpse will depict a small cozy diner bustling with energy as I have been there at dinner time. Fortunately we got our seats as we reserved earlier that day through phone. Ordered a Ribeye and Sirloin which were 300g each as per menu and done in true Texas style, which I was a bit skeptic at first. Then to my surprise they bought the raw cut in front of us and asked if we liked the cut and marbling. This is something we never experience in any steakhouse before, no one... asks about marbling of the meat in any steakhouse so far I have visited in Bangladesh. I started loving the place form that moment as the Ribeye had very good marbling in it. Just after that they served us complementary corn soups which were good gesture from their behalf and it was good too. Had to wait nearly 25 mins before we got the food and my friend asked the waiter why it takes this long to serve, then we came to know about the smoking process. They actually smoke each and every steak with imported woodchips and when we asked if they could show us the woodchips they certainly did, mixture of dry Apple & Hickory woodchips! Finally the steaks arrived and wow, perfectly seared medium rare steaks with juicy slight red center and dark crust outside. The first bite actually depicted all about that smoking stuff and for real it felt like I having a real steak, which I have seen for so long in TLC and other TV shows. The perfect thickness, sides of mashed potato and amazing sauces, though I did not like to use sauce in steaks as they are supposed to be juicy for medium rare done and in this case it was. Their service was good too as the waiters were polite and knowledgeable. This is my new favorite place for steaks and would highly recommend if anyone is looking for thick cut juicy steaks in Dhaka.",Positive
2201,Best steak in town right now and also liked the thing that they will at first show you the raw steak and if you are okay with it then they will grill it for you :D,Positive
2203,"my friends requested me to treat them in woodhouse on last Friday.... sorry to say, the taste was below our expectation, beef steak ( just like boiled beef) was very average & the jerk chicken ( too hard bbq ) was worst... . Price was really high comparing to its narrow place & food...I heard woodhouse's name numbers of time but unfortunately shocked last night & definitely will never go there... the positive part (well behaved staff).. :(",Negative
2205,"Took sirloin Steak, mashed potato, mushroom and poutine. All of the items were really mouthwatering. Environment was good. Service was very good. Loved the place.",Positive
2207,"They really do have some good sirloin steaks in the town. I havent been to all of thr steak houses in Dhaka, so i couldnt yet call them the best.",Positive
2209,"The steaks are a lot to be desired of..typical local rubbery meat. Dry. When I asked if medium would have pinkish hue, they said it would but at serving was well done. Perhaps that's why steaks were rubbery. Side dishes were okay..liked the mashed potatoes. Probably wouldn't recommend.",Negative
2211,Space is too small. We ordered Texas Tornado which was awful! No taste at all. Then we ordered Poutine. I asked for little salt and pepper. They couldn't give me Salt. Poutine was not up to the mark! Then we had Sirloin Steak Medium cooked which was okay type. They even forgot to serve my drink. Overall i didn't like it at all.,Negative
2213,"I took my sister who is a zealous steak lover, to this joint upon recommendations from my friends. She actually loved the quality, taste and generous size of the steak. However, the sitting arrangement was bit tight mostly due to the size of the restaurant floor. I would definitely love to visit again. Thanks for the wonderful food.",Positive
2215,"Wasn't up to the mark, had better expectations. I took sauteed vegetables as one of the sides and the carrots smelled kind of rotten.",Negative
2217,"It was nice. My family and I are steak lovers. They Could improve in the actual cooking of the steaks. When a customer wants medium or rare or well done, they should know precisely how much time it takes to cook the steak. Steak really goes well with baked potatoes and steamed vegetables. They should introduce baked or jacket potatoes. Would certainly visit again. The washroom could be better maintained. Thanks",Positive
2219,"In recent times, I've tasted many dishes but none has come close to the taste and deliciousness of the steaks of this place. The steak piece is so tender and juicy, meat juice literally comes out when you cut a piece of the steak. The side dishes with the steak are also delicious specially the sauces. The sauses enhanced the flavor of the steak. When i put a piece of steak in my mouth, it felt so good.I dare say, this place is the best place to get steak if you want taste, quality and quantity. i will come here again to taste everything asap. N.B.- The environment and the music of this place is excellent. Also the service was great Good luck to this place",Positive
2221,Price High. Interior medium. No music??!! Food quality Good. Customer Service and behavior very good. Will go again.,Positive

2288,Poor service. Took one hour 15 minutes to serve the steak and the taste was not good also. Had high expectations and was brutally disappointed!,Negative

2290,Loved my rare porterhouse!!!! Never thought that I’ll experience the steak � but satisfied 100%,Positive
2291,"Basically I like steak very much and I had it at different restaurants in Dhaka. But what I had today in Woodhouse Grill, simply awesome. It's the ultimate place a steak lover should visit. Their environment is very nice & clean and excellent service staffs although space is low comparing to other restaurants. Price is a little bit expensive but I found it worthy when I tasted the steak...its size, tenderness erc. Overall its a good restaurant to visit.",Positive
2292,"They served cold or not warm food, we was two but did not permit 4 seated table for seat us, Manager & Cook service very bad, they take service charge & Vat, but not provide vat chalan blue paper to Customers on request . Hope owner will recover all lacking.",Negative

2296,A great collection of prime cuts. The sides were not all that good. I'll recommend the mushroom and grilled vegetables as sides. But hey need some serious work on doneness. We ordered two medium rare rib eyes. Although the cuts were nice and thick one was way too rare the other way too well done. The searing was good. The drinks were chilled. Appetizers were great. Will come again.,Positive
2297,"As a beef lover, I loved the steak and the steak loved me back",Positive
2298,I went to Woodhouse Grill on Friday and was shocked to see such a small restaurant with no space between tables. It seems the tables are joining each other. Their prices are quite expensive considering that this is a very small restaurant in a small congested space. The service was poor. We were told that the food would arrive 45 mins. after ordering but the food arrived later. I suggested the owner to serve all the food together at a time instead of serving each order separ...ately. We ordered a t bone steak medium well which was brought out medium rare with blood remaining inside. We also ordered a sirloin medium well which was very dry. The steaks are kept frozen and after cooking it was not at all juicy. We also ordered grill chicken which was ok. The waiters are not well trained and don't know when to serve the drinks which should have arrived right after ordering but instead I had to remind the waiter yo bring out the drinks almost 30 mins. after ordering the drinks. Its a ok place but they need to improve service quality and better quality steak.,Negative
2299,Well i never usually give reviews. But i thought if i dont review this place that would be very unfair to them. I had an amazing experience there. I loved their steak. It was juicy and spicy. A perfect steak i must say!,Positive
2300,"Great flavor, my steak was done perfectly and the service was good. Small, chilled place and worth the price!",Positive
2301,"I have only one sentence to write as a review! Best Steak in the town, Period! ��",Positive

2303,It has to be the best steak place in Dhaka. The rib eye steak was done to perfection and the quality of the meat was sublime.,Positive
2304,"Great steaks, great service great environment. Felt a little cramped though, hope they will be expanding soon",Positive
2305,I Went last week with my friend and tried their Ribeye. It was awesome. One of the best places in Dhaka for Steaks.,Positive
2306,"Good food, lovely ambience, warm hospitality...!!!",Positive
2307,The food was good. Only one problem is that the place is too small. When there is a little bit more customers.. they became nervous... and made a little bit of mess while serving. The steak was good... I enjoyed the food,Positive
2308,Loved their steak! It was fresh and nicely cooked. Very well behaved and nice. Will recommend it to others. Keep up the good work!,Positive
2309,I visited the place with several colleagues yesterday for lunch. I had a mushroom stake. The stake was cooked to perfection. I really liked the food. Would love to go there again. One small thing is when the generator is on it makes noise which is a bit too much. They should find a way to minimize the sound inside the restaurant.,Positive
2310,"Excellent Food, Good service! Hope it stays always like this! :)",Positive
2311,"Taste I would give 7/10, Comparing the price the vegetables are less in amount. Accommodation is not up to standard to the Food Menu status and price. Washroom facility not OK. For Family and Ladies its a Hastel to use washroom out side of main place.",Negative
2312,Had one of the best Steaks in town!! Tried the T-Bone and the Rib Eye and both were top notch. The ambience was soothing and the service was brilliant by the staffs to go with it. Would suggest it to any steak lover. Will definitely drop by again to try their other steaks.,Positive
2313,Wonderful service and very friendly environment with a unique character to it! The food was super!! Definitely returning again! Keep it up!,Positive

2318,Good foods ... I love this place and I'll come again this place with my family,Positive
2319,"It's 4.5/5 actually. I want to say ""I loved it"" but minute details are holding me back. ""I really liked it!"" aptly describes it. Flavorful, tender, almost perfectly cooked ribeye and sirloin (5/5 for those) but t-bone was on the dry side. All sauces were on point though. (I'd recommend the hollaindase, pepper and bacon glaze hands down.) This place is a refreshing and much needed whiff of fresh air in the Dhaka steak situation. Definitely worth a try. I'm definitely going back (for the sirloin �) Also, 5/5 for hospitality. �",Positive
2320,"prime rib was decent, though a little overdone. i'd come back.",Positive
2321,"Good food,taste is awsome.staff behavior also good",Positive

2323,I had the Tomahawk steak last week. It looked incredible but tasted disaster. I asked for medium but they cooked well done for me. Their service was good as they cooked a new one but for my utter disappointment the second one was medium rare. Both the time the meat was really chewy and the mash was too sweet. The place is too small and congested. They should work hard on improving their cooking of the steak.,Negative
2324,This is the best place for real steak lovers. The owner was very nice and so were the staff. Gotta love the tomahawk. Please bring ribs.,Positive
2325,"This was absolutely exceptional. I would go as far to say you won't get a better steak in Dhaka and the strawberry cola is a must try. Was so impressed by the friendliness and knowledge of the staff and the reasonable Prices for such amazing food. Definitely give this place a try, you'll be more than happy you did �",Positive
2326,So far the steak in dhaka... loved it. Highly recommended,Positive

2340,"Went to Woodhouse Grill today. Already I had an Experience about the Steak in Bangladesh. So as usual with timid heart and boosted morale entered to the venue. Little small but neat and clean.....the employees are very cordial...soft spoken and well trained. They I have seen describing the customers in detail about the type of cut, dish and side dishes. I have met the owner little latter. He was also very cordial and helpful. To taste for the 1st time....I asked for a Pepper ...Steak and level of cooking I asked is Medium well done. I received the food and cut the piece of meat....the knife was smooth and I put the first piece in my mouth.....mmmmm....delicious.....but the cooking was Well Done. The owner observed my food and he was not satisfied with the cooking level, he returned my steak back and served another steak cooked in perfection as Medium Well Done. The incident depict how sincere and customer oriented they are. I am fully satisfied and wish to go frequently there. If the remain committed regarding their standard and customer satisfaction no doubt they will rise above the horizon....Viva Woodhouse Grill.

After you place the order they show you the pieces of meats/cuts - which is a great thing for the real steak lovers. The owner himself gave us briefs about all the steaks, making yourself clear about the one you are ordering.

I have been a regular customer of this restaurant and I can say that the quality of this restaurant is decreasing. The rice was not well cooked and vegetable was tasteless.",Negative

Then one table was empty and the waiter accommodated us that table. But a little while later when we were about to order food the waiter came and said this table was booked and we must leave it. They wanted us to give another table but there was no Air Conditioning there. So we had to leave the restaurant. Before leaving I told the incident to the man sitting in cash counter. But none of them simply apologized for it. Its only because of traffic jam and lack of good restaurants in banasree, we have visit such third class restaurants who do not even know what is customer service. This was my first and last visit to this restaurant.",Negative

We took chicken cashew nut salad as well as Thai fried rice, which were good, as well as their buffalo wings. But the beef sizzling that we ordered was pretty much burnt as the bottom part of the dish was clearly overcooked, unlike the almost undercooked top half. Nonetheless, they have good menu and a clean environment. Hope they improve more.",Negative

2424,Thanks to #foodbuzz for making a special day ‘Super Special’! Today I want to express my gratitude to foodbuzz who unconditionally helped me create a special memory! I wanted to give a surprise to my special one on our Aniversiry.The initial plan was to gather at foobuzz with all our friends and spend a nice time together. But I wasn’t sure if the people from there would cooperate without any booking or any charge. So I called at the number from their Facebook page and I was surprised instead at the enthusiasm and willingness they showed.There isn’t much I can do to repay them but I at least wanted to thank them here and inform people about their hospitality,Positive
2425,Tried the Larb Gai salad. Happy me :) Awesome place for partying.,Positive
2426,"Place : #foodbuzz ok so before I start rating their food and service and what not let me start off by saying what they did right that other restaurants usually don't. 1st - The food actually looks as they were advertised. 2nd - They actually served the food hot, yes you heard it right ""HOT"" this is where a lot of restaurant fails. They served all the food at the right time and in right order. ok now let's move on to what you guys really care about. Items -9/10 :kabsha, chusanut salad. Taste -9/10: I don't believe in perfection but this came pretty close, I would still rate it 9 but I gave 10 for a reason and I'll explain that in a bit. So anyway the chusanut salad really hot when it was served and it was tasty as well. Every item on that platter was upto the mark. Sorry I don't know the name of all the items otherwise I would've explained each item by their taste. Quantity: [10/10]: I don't know how much you can eat but I can eat a lot and I can tell you it's more than enough for 4 person.",Positive

2482,"Update about the Rating: This was one of my favorite place for hanging out with fnf. But faced something awkward and irritating in my last visit. Totally unprofessional behavior, if there's some problem to serve a specific item to me then it's better not to serve the same item to other while I am in your restaurant. I tried to order a specific item but the server said this item is not available, ok cool. I have gone for another item. but a Minute later I could see and hear t...hey were taking the same item's order from the next table. I didn't want to complain about the mismanagement at the cafe as some other visitor was there, I thought it would be better If I write it down to their complain book, so I asked for their complain book but they don't have a feedback or complain book. OMG. Rather the server insisted me to complain the problem to him directly, I denied and later the manager or accountant came to explain the scenario. Now come to the food part: I had ordered ""Schezwan Chicken, Rice"" and ""Mongolian Beef"" where the quantity was really poor and it doesn't even close to Schezwan Chicken's look or taste. Mongolian Beef's beef was hard to chew and again quantity was poor too. Old Rating: I will recommend this place to have the Fresh Juice and French Fries there. Reasonable price and comfortable couches to hang out with Friends. All the Other items I have tried need more improvement (Burger, Sub Sandwich and Regular Sandwich).",Negative

2489,Today we were the very first customer in the morning of Eid. We ordered and we were told we will get our foods within 10-12 minutes . But we had to wait more than 40 minutes for our food.

2682,"The burger was upto what a burger lover would expect it to be. The burger had that enough meat to fill your each bite, a bit work on making the meat juicy would make it a 5, though ur special sause on the burger and the cheese covered it up. I only tasted your chicken cheese rapture, looking forward to taste the other ones. The fries were crisp and chocolate shake was a 10/10 looking at the price and quantity. I would recommend you.

Oh they also have a couple’s place for make out and stuffs. If you want to try it in case.",Negative

2743,"While I'm a big fan of your food, I ordered a salad bowl via Pathao today and was disappointed. The packaging was an absolute mess and very disproportionately sized. Difficult for anyone to comfortably eat, you should work on a better way to deliver one of your signature items",Negative
2745,Sorry to say their Readymade tea is not so good what I expect from them � Nd their pealacchino s the worst coffee ever. I will not go there #never_ever. It was an worst experience for me n my frnd.,Negative
2747,Their lemon loaf is fantastic. But the salad is a deep disappointment. One teaspoon of dressing doesn't make the hearty portion any better. Also the flavours of chicken is very blunt. I ordered the salad bowl several times for lunch but today is the last day I guess until I see some changes. Thank you for the lemon loaf thought. Cheers!,Negative
2749,It happened twice that they failed to deliver food even though orders were accepted. Pathetic to say the least...,Negative

2755,I had wrap and tea at Payela. The meat they used for wrap was normal curry style meat. They can work on it.. The ambiance and service is so good. Desserts looks great! Tea was so good.. ‘ boro’.. costs 80! Isn’t it really over priced??!! But if I go next time I’ll have the tea for sure!,Negative
2757,The wrap was so fresh and tasty. All the tea was so flavorful. Environment was nice and calm .Like the place .,Positive
2759,First of all the roti wraps are awesome ! I personally prefer the beef achari one! Really tasty ! The place is awesome in one words for its interior & exteriors + food! Needs a good menu chart on corner of tables for getting to know what can be found according to customers needs! Overall a good place to hangout!,Positive
2761,Pretty good effort. They have been able to keep quality for a long time - always a major plus for Dhaka foods. Good value for money. Keeps your tummy full. Could improve with more and better options. Maybe with time. Their wraps are the Bangla version of Subway. Healthy and tasty.,Positive
2763,One of the best and amazing place. Love the #PeachIcedTea and the food served!!! The environment is lovely and the decoration as well. The food is served in a manner that attracts customers' attention. Worth visiting and a must try...Great Job keep it up (Y),Positive
2765,Love the place. I'm a regular customer here and I always bring my friends here to try their Gulab Jamun Cheesecake. They also make great wraps and you get to choose what ingredients go into it. This is by far one of the best cafes in Dhaka right now. They have successfully created a fusion between western food and Bengali food. 10/10 would recommend!,Positive
2767,The main thing I must admire is foods are tasty. I think this should be major thing to measure whether foods are tasty or not. And in terms of peyala place and foods are just awesome.,Positive

2771,The food is amazing but yesterday was the 4th time they either didn't have a wrap and can only give salad bowls or didn't have one of the two beef or chicken. Since the menu is really limited you guys should atleast try have a better stock so you can serve whatever is on the menu for that day instead of telling the customers they can only have salad bowls or only the beef with limited salad.,Negative
2773,Tired their salad bowl and one desert item I just loved both! Saladbowl was so fresh and yummy beyond my expectations! Their behavior is so good and environment is amazing. Highly recommend this place Definitely visit them again �,Positive

The place is very convenient for me and the behavior of the staff is reallllly really good.They are very well behaved and organized. Usually I don't write review's but this time PEYALA forced me to write something because of their delicious gulab jamun cheesecake and wrap which is very reasonable in price..

If you are a fan of a gulab jamun and cheese cake then their fusion gulab jamun cheese cake is a must try . It just melt in my mouth .",Positive
2889,"""Its okay"" perfectly sums up the experience... Not to expensive, neither it's cheap, it's just okay... They could have been a bit more generous with the fillings but as it turns out they are not... One wrap might not be good enough to fill an empty stomach, hence one less star...

3038,"The place is clean and the staff are very friendly , however I believe the management is very stingy. Most of the menus were 6 pieces ( pen corrected from 8.) instead of 8 pieces. The beef and chicken vegetable - are shamelessly small quantity and flooded with gravy to fill the plate. I have never seen such a Chinese dish with Indian curry like gravy and small portions . The manager might be trying to save money to have higher bonus . I believe any restaurant inspector will... Despite specifically requested for little or no chilies- the foods were served with red and green chilies and when complained they waived the price of ice cream (5 out of 10). I would spend my money some where else next time.",Negative
3039,"Environment is good, food is also tasty but you need to give more attention on your service quality, waiters are not available when we need, even they have no combination in giving service, 3-4 waiters are giving service in one table other people’s are waiting, so you need to much improve in management, Otherwise it was pretty good ��",Positive
3040,"Had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant on my short, but memorable trip to Dhaka almost two summers ago. The environment is clean and neat unlike the dark, dimly lit restaurants found lurking all over Dhaka city. The food and service were absolutely divine. Coming to Dhaka I realized nothing is truly authentic, you are expected to run into the fusions here. This restaurant takes the hat in asian fusion food. The exotic looking menu and the fresh quality food here was something remembered from my South Asia tour. Congratulations to the restaurant on holding their standard high over the course of the years. Locals say it's been around for more than 20 years and it shows in their service! I look forward to coming back and try those crabs again!",Positive

3087,"Worst than the worst Iftar platter I had yesterday with my colleagues at Gulshan 1 branch and none of them said anything different. when u complain about their food they'll tell you that they maintain food quality religiously in this month of Ramadan. Everyone likes food to be served hot, u don't need to remind that to your customer. Accept that you are of no good quality, there are plenty other good coffee shops in the town. We eat the food not the franchise. Iftar platter... had bland chicken hariyali kebab, fish fritters were way too much fried and cold, spicy grilled chicken with the friend rice was actually without any spice. I am sorry to say it was overall tasteless. Coleslaw with the chicken lemon oli was sour and inedible. I always had good expectations on GJ regarding food but you guys just did a very bad job in this month of Ramadan. Couldn't resist myself to make a point on it. Hope you guys will work on it.",Negative

3093,"Used to hangout daily at their Dhanmondi outlet on a regular basis. But the quality of their coffee went down sharply.

3245,"Okay, here we go: We've been charged 350 for ""imported milk"" despite not asking for it. When approached your cash counter lady, it seemed apparent that this was intentional & she was dumb founded as someone actually bothered to read the receipt! To top it off she charged us for the free coffee that we were entitled to off the loyalty card. And when asked for a manager, her colleague presented himself to be the one..LOL! I am not sure because of where you are located, you feel privileged to rip off your paying customers & assume we are a bunch of idiots, or that we won't bother with your microscopic itemised ""imported receipts!"" I recommend you use a fund raising box if you are so desperate. At least we will know the local Café is not trying to take us for a ride!!! NOTATION: Perhaps replace your deshi chhagols with some imported ones too..may be they'll come with a little more shame!

3285,"Might want to teach your staff a thing or two about customer service.They treat their customers like low life.. The staff themselves don't speak proper English and they have the audacity to hint at a paying customer to order in English! let me tell you something I am a Canadian born citizen to a WHITE Canadian father whose mother is a Proud Bengali.. I don't need your stupid staff to blabber in their grammatically incorrect English with a funny accent. I just wanted to practice ordering in Bengali since the location of this coffee franchise was in Bangladesh! The coffee itself wasn't too bad although not too special given the price ! Won't be coming back and won't recommend my fellow Canadians to visit either. Coffee I can make at home, it's the atmosphere that I wanted to enjoy !",Negative

And what do you mean when you say to your customer that there are CCTVs, so DO NOT SIT IN CLOSE CONTACTS? Why don't you put a notice or distribute pamphlet If you want your customer to follow such a CODE of CONDUCTS that is not against YOUR FAMILY VALUE? Do you think a boy and a girl go to Gloria Jean's to KISS EACH OTHER... in PUBLIC? How could it be against the FAMILY VALUE if two people sit together grabbing each other's hand?

3390,"Gloria Jean's Coffees Bangladesh- it's a coffee shop where coffee tastes horrible and other dishes taste quite well. They don't even concentrate on improving the taste of the Coffees. They are constantly trying to improve other dishes which are easily found in other ""restaurants"". I repeat ""Restaurants"". Last I checked Gloria jeans is not a restaurant, it's a coffee shop. My question is- Has Gloria jeans become a restaurant or is it still a coffee shop? You guys are selling... deserts, fried rice, burgers and many other things very efficiently and they taste quite good as well. But when it comes to your coffee, they taste like shit. I have been going there for a long time and it's unacceptable from a great coffee shop like this one. I have been going to various coffee shops for a long time and that's how I developed a keen taste for Coffees. I know the variations of Coffees and the taste of them. In other coffee shops, the variations of coffee is quite amazing. Here one day I ordered ""cafe mocha"" and it tasted as usual. The next time I went there, I ordered a ""cappuccino"". I couldn't even differentiate between those two because both of them tasted the same. There is no depth and aroma in these coffees. If I can't find the variations among the different types of Coffees, then why the hell anyone should come here to taste these horrible Coffees with such high prices? They certainly maintain a standard about other dishes and they taste really good. But as a coffee shop, they don't deserve to get a rating of 1.",Negative

3399,I went there yesterday. It was a busy time. I ordered Steam rice with Steam chicken for me and Grilled chicken for my friend. Unfortunately both chicken were cold but part of the grilled chicken was very cold. I ordered Latte and at last but to be honest it was cold as well. the Waiters need to be little bit more trained as I was looking for them at least 7-10 mins to clean my table and also they should have some knowledge about the food. Overall I can not give more than 3 star this time. Hope next time I will have a more good experience. Thanks,Negative

3414,"#ইতিহাস_কথা_বলে বর্তমান পৃথিবীতে প্রতিদিন পায় ১৬০ কোটি কাপ কফি পান করা হয়ে থাকে । বিলিয়নের মত মানুষের কাছে কফি পান রীতিমত নিত্যদিনের ব্যাপার । তবে আমরা অনেকেই এই কফি প্রচলনের ইতিহাসটা জানি না । ঐতিহাসিক দলিল মোতাবেক , ১৪০০ সালের দিকে ইয়েমেনের মুসলিম সমাজে কফি সর্বপ্রথম জনপ্রিয়তা পায় । কিংবদন্তী অনুসারে , ইয়েমেন কিংবা ইথিওপিয়ার এক মেষপালক হঠাৎ লক্ষ্য করে তার মেষগুলো অজানা এক প্রকার গাছের পাতা খেয়ে সতেজ হয়ে উঠছে । এটা দেখে নিজের উপর ব্যাপারটা পরীক্ষা করার ইচ্ছা জাগে তার । মেষপ...ালক সেই পাতা খায় এবং লক্ষ্য করে এর ফলে তার ক্লান্তি দূর হয়ে সতেজ ভাব লাগছে । এ ঘটনার পর থেকে কফির দানা গরম পানিতে দিয়ে পান করার ব্যপারটা ইয়েমেনে প্রচলিত হয়ে পরে । আর এভাবেই উদ্ভব হয় বর্তমান পৃথিবীর খুবই জনপ্রিয় একটি পানীয়, কফির । মেষপালকের এ ঘটনাটি সত্য হোক বা মিত্যা হোক , এ ব্যাপারটা নিশ্চিত যে কফির প্রচলন হয় ইয়েমেন থেকেই এবং ইয়েমেন হয়ে কফি সমগ্র উসমানী খিলাফতে (অটোমান খিলাফত) ছড়িয়ে পরে । এর পর সমগ্র মুসলিম এলাকার গুরুত্বপূর্ন শহরগুলো, যেমন- ইস্তাম্বুল, বাগদাদ, কায়রো, দামাস্কাসে কফিহাউস তৈরি করা হয় । এরপর মুসলিম সভ্যতা থেকে কফি ইতালীর ভেনিস হয়ে ইউরোপে জনপ্রিয়তা অর্জন করে । ইউরোপে কফিকে নিন্দাভরে “মুসলিম ড্রিঙ্ক” নামে ডাকতেন তখনকার ক্যাথলিক প্রশাসনের কর্মকর্তারা (মুসলিমরা অনেকেই সারারাত জেগে আল্লাহর ইবাদত করতেন । রাত জাগার ক্লান্তি দূর করতে তারা কফি পান করতেন । মূলত এখান থেকেই “মুসলিম ড্রিঙ্ক” নামের উদ্ভব। - অনুবাদক) । কিন্তু ইউরোপের সাধারন জনতা কফিকে খুবই আন্তরিকভাবে গ্রহন করেছিলেন , এবং নিজেদের জীবনের অবিচ্ছেদ্য অংশ করে নিয়েছিলেন । ১৬০০ শতকে ইউরোপের কফি হাউসগুলো বিভিন্ন রাজনৈতিক, সামাজিক, সরকারের সমালোচনার স্থান হয়ে উঠেছিলো । পরবর্তীতে এ কফিহাউস ভিত্তিক আলোচনাই ইউরোপে অনেক নবজাগরনের পথ সূচনা করেছিলো । ইয়েমেন কিংবা ইথিওপিয়ার সেই মেষপালকের হাত ধরেই পরবর্তীতে প্রতিদিন প্রায় ১ বিলিয়ন কাপ কফি ইউরোপের জনসাধারনের রাজনৈতিক চিন্তাধারাকে উজ্জীবিত রাখে । সেই সাথে আমরা বলতে পারি , মুসলিমদের মাধ্যমে জনপ্রিয়তা পাওয়া এই পানীয়টি নিঃসন্দেহে মানব ইতিহাসের অন্যতম গুরুত্বপূর্ন আবিস্কার । লেখাটি Lost Islamic History সাইটের “5 Muslim Inventions That Change The World” শীর্ষক প্রবন্ধের প্রথম অংশ থেকে নেয়া হয়েছে । অনুবাদক- মাসুদ ফেরদৌস ইশান।",Negative

But he didn't think its necessary to inform the customer. Then after some time I called, a waiter come I said give her a seven up, he said seven not available, sprite available. Okey bring one. But no response. After five mins he is facing back of our table. Then I called then the first waiter come. Bull shit service, you have luck if family is not with me, I would teach you a lesson.",Negative
4188,One of the best place to dine... Kebabs are fantastic... very good Hamus... beautiful decorations... set menus are reasonable... must try...,Positive
4190,"The first glance of the place with its magnificent Lebanese inspired decorations immediately gave out an impression of the middle east. Simple yet subtle. The moment I took a bite of the kabab, I felt like I was back in the Arabian peninsula. The soft arabian music and the lightings and ofcourse the humble waiters dressed in the finest attires helped to complement the feel I suppose. They really did deliver the so called Arab ""ZAYKA"". If nothing else the chefs of this place are some of the finest artists in the world. A 5 star rating would not suffice to describe the experience. I offer them my compliments and look forward to their future endeavours.",Positive
4192,First of all the decoration of the place is too beautiful. It increases with the Lebanese songs. The food we ordered was happy hour set menu which was so delicious specially the chicken mushroom curry and rice. Quantity was also good for single person. The sauce needs to be better as it was slight spicy. Chicken was average. The behaviour of the staffs was not good that I experienced. I found them kinda rude. When we were selecting the food from the menu they immigrated showed us another menu and said may be we could not afford that. That was so insulting though we all stayed there to taste the food. Overall the experience was good except the behaviour of the staffs.,Positive
4194,Finally I loved your Iftar platter. The place is welcoming with quality service. Keep it up! :),Positive
4196,"I'm not sure why but word around town is that this place sucks. It definitely doesn't. The kebab items, especially the shish tawuq was quite good. Condiments were nice. The only thing I'd complain about is price - it's quite expensive. A two person sharing kebab platter with drinks will easily cost you 2000 bdt or a little less than USD 30.",Positive
4198,The food was good. Environment nice. The behaviour of the stuff are quite good. Overall liked the place.,Positive
4199,"Had the Biriyani with Chicken yesterday. Over priced and worst food that I have had in my entire life. Heard a lot of good things about this place, but turned out to be such a disappointment. The chicken was not even properly cooked. Price is undoubtedly high in terms of quality of food. Will never visit again",Negative
4200,"Less spicy, good ambiance, service is also good.",Positive
4201,"Had great expectation for this place. Went there on Valentines Day. Only thing I enjoyed was their Lebanese themed decoration.Price of the food was overpriced. Furthermore, they served us cold food except Lebanese bread which was the only thing that was hot. Behavior of the staffs were unprofessional. Disappointed ....don't think will visit again.",Negative
4202,"There was no reason to go here, specifically, as my friend and I were both on a tight schedule. He had come on a return visit to his homeland from America, and wanted to meet up, after 12 years (for him) and 20 years for me.. also looking for a place near his old house where he grew up. It was just beyond! Meeting a friend after 20 years can be a very, very surreal experience, and I am quite glad that Al-Amar helped to enclose those memories.",Positive

Did not taste like real KSA food or Arabic food , to be honest . They did serve a garlic sauce, which appeared to have been made by someone who never tasted real garlic sauce from the mid- east. The owners need to visit the mid- east before they can successfully add that Arabic touch to their food.",Negative

4306,Last year when I visited Al Amar I was really happy with their service and authentic Lebanese taste. I actually found the Arabic taste same as abroad.

4355,"Yaa habibi!! The hummus is divine, the tahine thick and rich, and the décor and music all transport you to a magical Mediterranean realm. Al-Amar features a wide variety of Lebanese as well as Oriental dishes. True that the price is somewhat above the average range for restaurants in the area, but it's still within reasonable limits given the quality and portions of the food served, and the warm service received. The drinks are interestingly refreshing. We opted for the hummus and kafta antabli (lamb skewers), the ice honey tea and mint lemonade. Not disappointed at all. Very pleasant atmosphere too.",Positive

4379,"We placed an order over the phone for takeaway and were told that food would be ready in approximately 35 mins. I went after 45 mins to pick up the food and it still wasn't ready. I had to wait another 10 mins for them to prepare the parcel. Other than this setback, let's get into the food review: 1) Lamb Kabseh, priced at 645++. The meat & rice were cooked well and the portions were sufficient for 2 (provided you take some appetizers). However, I did not really like the over...whelming tomato taste. I prefer a drier kabseh with bigger portions of meat and garlic sauce but that's just my opinion. I'd rate this 2.5/5. Since it's quite pricey, I don't really recommend this. 2) Hommos, priced at 325++. Although this may sound too expensive for just mashed chickpeas with a bit of oil and mild seasoning, trust me it's worth it. Portions are more than enough to share for 2 (you can even take this for 3). Also, you can get extra bread for 20 taka each if you do run out of bread. I'd rate this 4/5. Highly recommended. 3) Lahem Bi Ajin, priced at 300++. These are mini beef keema pizzas which taste fantastic!!! Initially I was expecting a gravy dish because the description says 'marinated minced beef cooked with spices & tomatoes the traditional way' and was kinda bummed out when I saw mini pizzas but once I took a bite, I was blown away. They also give you a slice of yellow lemon (proper imported yellow lemon, and not the crap we get here which are being passed off as lemons) which adds so much to the flavor of the dish. 5/5, I'd have this everytime I go there. And since you get 8 slices, it's superb value for money for 2 people. My total bill was 1537 BDT (including 6% service charge and 15% VAT). I am quite confused as to why I had to pay service charge for a takeaway order, they definitely should remove that. Otherwise, it's not too heavy on the pocket for something different (provided you don't take the kabseh).",Positive
4380,I love all their foods & service.,Positive
4381,Allah will bless Al- Amar Lebanese Cuisine Bangladesh and best of luck,Negative
4382,Good food... nice place! I really liked the hamos and lamp mechew!!!,Positive

4407,I would like to draw attention of the owner of this restaurant that your staff quality is very poor and they don't know how behave with the customers.

4409,"Went there with wife, thought to pass some quality time with family. Found there was a meeting party going shouting like common dhaka fish market. When we realised the situation we wanted to cancel the order but restaurant forced us to pay but they can not control the environment and make it ok for gentle man. we are pissed off. I don't want to make comment about food as after feeling devastated with the shouting from the unpleasant meeting guys we took parcel and found the food taste like sh*t, even chicken was not properly fried.",Negative

4426,Very disappointed with their behavior.... we around 51 people booked them for iftar. Took their highest price iftar menu but their food quantity is very poor. They were very unprofessional and rude in behavior. At the time of iftar they forgot to serve one item listed in the menu but we didn't shout just politely informed them. And it took so long to serve the rest item that we already had finished our iftar. After iftar we stayed and we ordered aprox 20 cup of coffeee and paid the bill of that extra coffee but still they were forcing us to leave their restaurant and we were surprised at their such unprofessional attitude. They might not have experience to handle a crowd or any party booking. CAUTION: PLEASE THINK BEFORE ARRANGING ANY GATHERING OR PARTY BOOKING HERE.,Negative

4555,5 out of 5,Positive
4556,"The place is clean and the staff are very friendly , however I believe the management is very stingy. Most of the menus were 6 pieces ( pen corrected from 8.) instead of 8 pieces. The beef and chicken vegetable - are shamelessly small quantity and flooded with gravy to fill the plate. I have never seen such a Chinese dish with Indian curry like gravy and small portions . The manager might be trying to save money to have higher bonus . I believe any restaurant inspector will... reject this ( if there is a licensing authority -unfortunately there is none ) . Despite specifically requested for little or no chilies- the foods were served with red and green chilies and when complained they waived the price of ice cream (5 out of 10). I would spend my money some where else next time.",Negative
4557,"Environment is good, food is also tasty but you need to give more attention on your service quality, waiters are not available when we need, even they have no combination in giving service, 3-4 waiters are giving service in one table other people’s are waiting, so you need to much improve in management, Otherwise it was pretty good ��",Positive
4558,"Had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant on my short, but memorable trip to Dhaka almost two summers ago. The environment is clean and neat unlike the dark, dimly lit restaurants found lurking all over Dhaka city. The food and service were absolutely divine. Coming to Dhaka I realized nothing is truly authentic, you are expected to run into the fusions here. This restaurant takes the hat in asian fusion food. The exotic looking menu and the fresh quality food here was something remembered from my South Asia tour. Congratulations to the restaurant on holding their standard high over the course of the years. Locals say it's been around for more than 20 years and it shows in their service! I look forward to coming back and try those crabs again!",Positive

Complete bullshit and later realized their menu wasn't transparent and didn't mention exactly what would be in the platter. 50% of the platter tasted like old leftovers and the nan's were clearly old and just short of stale.

The platter is not at all worthier may b they brush with burnt burnt and used oil. Butter nan has no butter it dry and when you eat its sandy!! All the appetite will go seeing the glass they use for serving fresh juice.. Juice taste is not good either you can only taste rock salt! Price is too high which derives to disappointment.

4741,I appreciate their service. It was great. but test of Hydarabadi Biriyani ruined everything. the food they served was not actually Hydarabadi Biriyani. it was 5 or 6 time sweeter. other foods are just ok. I'll not give very bad review. service 10/10. atmosphere 9/10. test 6/10.,Positive

4744,"I was very disappointed with your hyderabadi birayani. I ordered for my nani shashuri and she was really looking forward to having it since I raved so much about this restaurant. I am so embarassed. She tried a spoon and that is it. When I tried it, first thing I tasted was choon, like not kidding. Then the sweetness hit me so hard, I was pretty dumbstruck. I did order dosa as well, which she ate thankfully. But I am sorry to say, hyderabadi biriyani tasted like jorda with mutton pieces. Hope you will look into this matter. Thank you.",Negative

4748,"As I'm writing this review it's breaking my heart that my favorite restaurant's quality has fallen so much...the other day I ordered 'palak paneer and aloo paratha..n palak paneer was rotten...I informed you about that...n today I m at your place and we face almost same situation. We ordered 1 khichuri thali and one Naan thali and one chicken butter masala. ... 1) khichuri thali: shockingly there was a hair in khichuri! !! My pregnant sis was craving for your khichuri..we or...dered 2 hours before we reach tarka so that we can get the khichuri thali...and that's what she get??? Amazing! There was another time I got hair on my salad but I overlooked it..but today! !! Anyway. ..now the bhortas. ..whenever we ordered khichuri thali we got Taki machher bhorta. .. and today we got tasteless, flooded with mustard oil alu bhorta which we weren't informed before. .when my sis asked the waiter he gave a lame explanation that is 'amra ekekdin ekek bhorta dei' how come we never got any other bhorta!! Lameness er limit thake..if you ran out of food..you could inform us!!and the Kala bhuna...we requested that the last timewe orderedit was so hard that we could hardly eat..n today..it was just same!! UNEXPECTED 2) Naan thali: I ordered garlic Naan..they served plain Naan...when I complain they replaced it with garlic Naan..it it was hard and cold...though they heat it..it was hard...I don't know what happened to tarkas that Naan. ..which used to melt in mouth....everything in the thali was cold. ..daal was more like home made daal chorchori...n palak paneer. ..saltless. ..tasteless. ..it didn't even had the buttery texture it used to have....DISAPPOINTED 3)chicken butter masala : taste was good...but the ratio according to price is very very poor..I tried chicken butter masala before but I had no idea that your restaurant serves it with minced chicken. Anyway...your restaurant was our favorite place..but after having back to back horrible experience. ..my n my family quit...we are never coming back. ..highly dissatisfied and hurt. ..all the best",Negative

4756,"Its not rocket science as to figure out why i go back to Tarka again & again and during Ramzan, I thought of giving a break but alas! Just had the Jilapi or Jalebi as they spell like this for some weird unknown reason & hands down this is the best in town. Any other argument regarding this is invalid. Period! Also tried their Ramzan Special 'Nan Thali' & its amazing value for money. The taste is as usual superbly trustworthy like their other foods. I actually have to order an extra butter Nan to finish off the nan-thali coz the amount is so much. highly recommend this place during the Ramzan & other times.",Positive

4760,We went there before the ramadan and ordered hydrabadi biriyani and it was the worst. It had a very bad smell and when we told the waiters they said it was normal but it wasnt. As far as i know biriyani doesnt have that kind of smell. Handi's one is far better.. -_-,Negative

4789,"I really enjoyed the environment, the smell of the food from tables. It was mouthwatering. The food proportion on each thali and regular items were sufficient.

4795,price is high but food is great...,Positive
4796,"There was a time not long ago when the choice for good authentic Indian restaurant in Dhaka was limited to Sajna and Khazana only, and then came Tarka with their mind blowing ""never tasted"" authentic Indian menu in a casual yet classy ambiance. So far I have tried all of their lunch thalis (except Veggie and Rice, as I am not much into those), and from their regular menu mutton hyderbadi biriyani, chicken lagawab makhani, beef boti, chickten tikka, khusnama kabab, daal butter... fry, matar paneer, mughal chicken, kashmiri/butter/garlic nan and I can't rank anyone better than the other as for their quality is 5 star. As for the drinks my favorite is Jeera Pani. It's also good to see that their service level has drastically improved since their inception and now I don't mind paying the 7% service charge. Also a nice addition was their Iftar menu during Ramadan and particularly the 'haleem' which I fell in love after first sip. I have intentionally held off my review until now as I wanted to test them over time for their consistency which they have proved so far. Keep up the great taste & service and wish you all the best in the business.",Positive

Tarka, serioulsy u need to work on the interior and its decoration beacuse atm it looks like a typical bangla bhaat er hotel where flies flying around you with ac and cameras! It doesnt match with the food you serve there at all! Now comes to food review, it very rare nowadays the food you have ordered in a resutarant and later all of them comes as a bomb of delicouse food!

We stepped on there at 1:05. Ordered 6 dosa only. Told them that my daughter came Streight from school and we need at least 1 dosa early we waited for an hour. And walked out. In the mean time we saw ( as we sat in from of the kitchen door) a lady in burka , most probably she was one o your staff members and her son walked in to the kitchen.

Seriously didnt like this attitude. Please don't do this again. Now comes the food rating - Food- 10/10 (best Indian food in town). Specially the Lassi.

4856,"Really bad experience. I ordered a masala dosa and pani puri. My wife ordered a beef roll. The food was taking a while so we decided to order some take away as well while waiting. The first served me the dosa while not serving anything to my wife. The dosa was hard like crystallized caramel! While we started eating the dosa we asked for the remaining orders. After about ten minutes they came back with the pani puri. I finished my meal while my wife was still waiting for her beef roll which arrived even after the take away food was ready. To add to all this misery regarding the service, the food was horrible. Not worth the time, anxiety, or money. Not going back unless the entire serving staff is changed or trained properly. The chefs need some training as well.",Negative

4890,Given the price it was hard to believe they were able to pull it off....kudos to you guys. Good for a date . Good for a casual hangout or a meet up. Best not to bring family here though as the customer base for this shop is mostly teenagers or people like me with a shallow pocket.,Positive
4891,"1. The crust was really thin, almost like a Ruti. 2. Amount of cheese was not bad. 3. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant, there was hardly any chicken even masroom in the chicken supreme pizza. You can also count the olives. 4. The overall taste was good but for 279tk, considering the toppings, it was overpriced. The making of pizza in an oven in front of you is the main attention. You can give it a try but not really a place to go back just to have the pizza. Definitely overhyped and overrated. Best of luck.",Negative
4892,"Well as i was born and bought up in this area I had basically tried all kinds of food around this place...so not gonna lie.... Now about pizza....i basically like it cause the crust the flavor all of it is good like if u expect to have a real pizza there are other places for that this pizza is for people who eats outside regularly and want some good food in a cheap rate.This is why i said good instead of 'soo good' Told ya not gonna lie About the place and environment - it's ...a street food court so it's under the open sky.You can bring hr friends and family and have a good time.And as usual there are some overly attached couples who comes here & makes us uncomfortable, i guess if u are not a hypocrite u wouldn't put the blame on this place. In the end all i have to say about this place is ""places with good food and environment is not that available .But this place is all of it "" ���",Positive
4893,"Well the crust was really thin, almost felt Like a Nun Ruti. Amount of cheese was okay. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant in the beef pizza. Portion of beef is again okay though there was hardly any chicken in the chicken pizza. You can also count the olives. The overall taste was good for 200tk. But considering the toppings, 200 tk is not cheap rather an okay price tag. They only have 8 inch pizzas. For a guy like me, I could easily eat Two and go for ...a kacchi afterwards. (Not Kidding). You can give it a try but not really a place to go back just to have the pizza. Great try though. Cheers.",Negative

4896,"Their behaviour was bad, i repeat their ""BEHAVIOUR"" was ""BAD"". We wanted some change as we gave all of our ""khuchra"" tk at the time of order. But they didn't even have the courtesy to say politely that they didn't have any change, it was like we were beggars asking them for money. We ordered both chicken and beef, the amount of chicken was really poor, it was really a fancy cheese version of typical local pizza. So don't get confused by the price.",Negative

But later on we wanted to give a 500 taka note instead of those 100 taka notes because it was urgent to have some changes.

4952,"Fine dining? eh? Very own app? Using some garbage 3rd party app that's not even built for a specific restaurant. Does not work properly. Has so many bugs. And finally, takes 5 minutes to place an order...and then someone has to accept it from Umai...which nobody does. 10 minutes wasted lmao. 25% discount if order through app? But only for one item in cart! Ordered Chicken Karaage. Came without any Soy sauce. Dry af tiny crispy chicken without any taste. Next up Umai Special Creamy Salmon Roll and another Salmon Roll. Big in names; tiny in sizes. Yuuuge in prices. Have had these types of foods in many other places but yours are by far the worse in taste, size but super high on the price. Your 1300tk stuff is worth at most 400tk. I don't mind paying 1.3k or even 2k for a few pieces of rolls. But the food quality has to match, right?",Negative
4954,"Love this place! They are a fine dining establishment, with really great food, great service and, as expected, a hefty price tag against every item available. Despite of the feeling of despair I get whilst paying the bill, I still managed to go there a number of times, and haven't been disappointed once However, my latest visit was yesterday, and this time around, I faced a serious problem which prompted me to write this review. We ordered ""Beef Udon Noodles"" which is a fav...orite of my wife, and at the very end of the dish, we found some coiled strings. These things definitely came from the wired sponges that are used for scrubbing the plates when a dish washer is not available. So the person who cleaned the plates wasn't competent, and the chef was not vigilant enough to check this before serving the dish. It wasn't a big deal, but we had a bad feeling. We kind of lost our appetite, and called in the waiter to tell this to his manager. Knowing Bangladeshi restaurants, we weren't hoping for much. However, the manager came in almost running, and profusely apologized. He wanted to replace the dish. But by then, we were full and didn't have the appetite to eat more. So I refused. Then the manager told us that he will remove the bill for the noodles, and we can have any main dish from the menu for free. When I said we are no longer hungry, he said we can also have it made for ""take away"". By then, I was quite surprised. I haven't really seen such behavior from any other restaurant in Dhaka. But then again, I also did not find strings in the food in any other restaurant. But that is not really the point, the point is the nice gesture shown by Umai. After declining this generous offer, the manager seemed sad and apologized again and left. After 4-5 minutes, I asked for the bill, and the waiter informed that we will be served complimentary desserts and then the bill will be given. This was something I could not refuse. So me, my wife and child totally enjoyed the free Banana Katsu dessert (which was the most expensive dessert in the menu) and came out with a satisfied mind. I hope they continue this kind of customer service and improve the kitchen vigilance. I wish them all the best as I want them to stick around and keep on serving us high quality Japanese food.",Positive
4955,Just love this place...peaceful environment..excellent service and well behaved management! Super like! �,Positive
4956,"The salmon belly was absolutely mouthwatering, authentic japanese taste..so was the fresh salmon salad, the dish lives up to its name..the devils breath maki rolls were really good too! All in all, most of the food items are amazing and the overall food experience very good!",Positive
4957,"Food is awesome, and has some thing special which will drive you here again and again. Visited with my family and had chicken teriyaki, deep fried Seafood, fried prawn, Umai special soup with strip of loin beef and for desert banana kastu. All were very good and unique in taste. Must complement their Japanese Chef and the Umai management. All foods are imported and service is excellent as well.",Positive
4958,"Frankly the best sushi I had in a while. From the food to the ambiance to the staff, everything SCREAMS five star. If you're ready to drop some serious cash and a taste for the high end, you'll love this place!",Positive
4959,I was first time goer to Umai last evening. It was a great evening with my cousin-sister & sister like friend. My sister (cousin) recommended salmon teriyaki as I was looking for something on Salmon for long.. It was pretty good but I think they put less salt on it. Ambiance is perfect for any chaos/noise free dining with loved ones.,Negative
4960,"Such a overpriced menu! Prices are more than even Sydney :O There are lots of sushi/Bento shops around Sydney City, provides more quantities/varieties in Bento with even lesser price (around $6-$10 = BDT 350-550) Sushi long each $3-$4 (150-240 BDT) Considering cost in Sydney (place and stuff cost in Sydney at least 10 times than BD..) what would be the reason of such high price??",Negative
4961,"This is very disappointing when you go for unlimited maki offer provided with set menu A, but ended up waiting forever and getting only two maki pieces per person. Either it's a mismanagement or a deception.",Negative
4962,"Far from a conventional Japanese diner, UMAI is haute to the hilt. Purely the name suggests, the menu offers widest gamut of mouth-watering delicacies, including scrumptious sea foods, zesty meats, splendiferous staples, as well as tantalizing desserts. This chiefly Japanese restaurant is one culinary casting that satiate an appetite, and worthy of repeated encores...",Positive
4963,"We went for the iftar offer, bento box plus unlimited maki. By unlimited I guess they meant two maki pieces per person. We sat for an hour and waited to no avail. The quality of food wasn't that good either.",Negative
4964,"We went to Umai when it originally opened. It was pretty good. Over time, the quality has reduced tremendously. We just had food delivered at home - extremely poor quality and horribly prepared. Not edible by any standards. A complete and utter waste of money.",Negative
4965,"Very good preparation - really tasty. Will be coming again as soon as possible. As usual though, food price in Bangladesh is fashionably exorbitant. Umai needs to look into the portion of each serving/ dish.",Positive

4968,had a great japanese food experience. loved every bit of it,Positive
4969,Food is very excellent both in taste and texture. You can have stomach full but not feeling so heavy. Soothing environment and welcoming. Limited parking space is the only drawback.,Positive
4970,Tbh I was expecting more from UMAI.. Saw so many good reviews of this place! But in reality the food wasn't good! and the staffs were trained alright! Trained to deceive the customers! Bad Food + Bad Behavior! Also they seemed to behave differently with some guests.,Negative
4971,"Never thought I'd be THIS disappointed with Umai's food/service. The offer is exceedingly deceiving as it is called 'Bento with ""unlimited"" servings of maki rolls' whereas the restaurant isn't even prepared to serve more than 1/2 maki rolls per person throughout the entire time.",Negative
4972,Best Japanese food,Positive
4973,"From ambience to taste to service everything was 10 on 10. And unlimited maki roll was really unlimited, along with my wife we consumed 20 rolls. Would love to visit there again and again. Their continues supply of maki roll in the 1st comment.",Positive

5013,"Decor best I have seen in Dhaka. Classy yet understated, intimate ambiance. Food is pretty good, and compared to Izumi, reasonably priced. Sashimi, grilled squid and octopus starter and banana katsu dessert were excellent.",Positive
5014,The food quality was good but serving size could be increased considering that the price is quite high compared to other high end restaurants in Gulshan. Suggest to sign up with Amex and Visa for promotions which other restaurants are doing especially upscale restaurants which offer up to 20% discount. Could offer live cooking stations like at Wasabi. The seating areas are quite congested with limited seating space.,Positive

5371,এলাকার মাঝে খুব সুন্দর ডেকোরেশন দেখে গিয়েছিলাম। কিন্তু আপনাদের খাবারের মান ও পরিমান দামের সাথে একেবারেই মানানসই না। বিশেষ করে আপনাদের থাই চিকেন ফ্রাইয়ের অবস্থা শোচনীয়। ৩৫০ টাকা চার্জ করে চিকেন পপ সাইজের ৬ পিস চিকেন কিভাবে দিচ্ছেন আবার ধারনার বাইরে। যেখানে জে কোন চাইনিজে ৪০০-৪৫০ টাকার ১০ পিসের মেনু পাওয়া জায় [বড় সাইজ] স্বাদও তেমন ভালো না। মনে রাখবেন মানুষ খাবারের মান ও স্বাদের জন্য আবার আসবে। ডেকোরেশন দেখতে না। আমি তো আর আসছি না।,Negative
5374,"So... I tried this restaurant for the very first time along with my friends/colleagues/sisters/brothers. It's a new venture & a place of many things, but kebab items are the best. We tried their Chicken jhal tewari(probably i forgot the name), burgers,kebab,paratha,lemonade(candy lemonade is the best),fresh orange juice & oreo milkshake. If u want a cosy environment to hangout with friends n family & enjoy food with affordable price this is the place where u should go.

5409,I have always been a great fan of Lucknow. I have always found it homely since inception of Horitoki (it's previous name). But I would like to point out that: Staff: some of them are great but sometimes some of their staff seem indifferent to needs & Food: Their mixed vegetables contain more carrot than other veggies. First I thought it could be a random issue but later I found it to be true. I understand cutting cost but not expected from a high end restaurant like Lucknow.,Positive
5411,"I m absolutely loved the food, The only thing that Lucknow does better than thier food is their service. Tariq was a super helpful manager, who made sure we taken care of amidst the hustle and bustle during the rush hour for seheri. Its one of the very few restaurants in dhaka who truly cares about thier customer. Cheers!",Positive
5412,Haven’t been to a place like this in a long while! Food is not so good. Actual food differs from what’s on the menu / waiter says while taking booking / order.,Negative
5413,"Experience is not good at all. Taste of the Food is not good, price seems high. The waiter gave us wrong information regarding quantity sharing of platters. In a nutshell, we gather a bad experience with this restaurant...",Negative
5415,Me and my husband went there yesterday with our two kids. We went for lunch and that time most of the tables were empty and we wanted to sit at a corner table but the waiter told if there'll be more people they won't be able to sit and showed us a table just with the entrance gate. It was almost the ending time of lunch hour so how can they expect more guests and how rude was their behavior I was wondering. Although we didn't take that sit and choose another one. But this shouldn't be the behavior with the guests. Anyways foods were good.. handi biriany was horrible.. price is too high.. too 1 hour to serve the dishes.. service is too bad.. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Worst service I've ever seen.,Negative
5417,undoubtedly best kabab in the town. every time I visited the restaurant they have made their standards better than before. Consistancy of their food taste and quality is equal yet.,Positive
5419,"Hello. My family as well as myself are very frequent customers at Lucknow. Sad to say, today was by far the worst experience I've had. The orders were placed to be taken away. 1. I've ordered a Beef Bhuna; now from my frequent orders, I know what to expect. It is always served cut in to little cubes. Today I got 2 bones and 2 chunks in the item out of which consisted of fat. This was never the case. 2. I've ordered for Chicken Butter Masala. Once I reached home I came to disc...over that it tastes different. I didn't bother checking the receipt before I left because Lucknow has never failed to reach my expectations, but when I did, it was listed Chicken Tikka Masala. 3. The condiments (salad and dressings) were missing. 4. The Naushijan Vegetable Biriani hardly had any vegetables other than potatoes. Also it was extremely spicy.",Negative
5421,"Horrible food. Shouldn't have listen to my wife to go there in the first place. We went there at 2:30PM and server told us kitchen will be closed at 3 and we have to order fast with an attitude. Once the food came, presentation was nice but taste was horrible. Definitely won't go there ever again!",Negative
5422,"As per taste,quality and quantity, price is too high. Also food is not a good taste.",Negative
5423,One of best Indian food you can find in Dhaka. Gravy is the most recommended.,Positive
5424,"Let's talk about the place first. Located at the edge of Sat Masjid Road near the Dhanmondi 27 turning, which provides to be central location for people coming in from Mohammadpur, Lalmatia or Dhanmondi. While they do not have a dedicated parking place they try to make up for it by having numerous guards. Interior is very nice. Well decorated, modern and unlike some very dimly lit restaurants opening up nowadays, this proved to be a welcoming experience offering something qui...te on the contrary. The ambience is very inviting with music in the background and ample room between tables to not overhear the conversations from tables nearby. We were a family of four. After being handed the menu which had decent amount of items we ordered a standard Chinese dinner for my parents whilst me and my sister opted for something from the Indian cuisine. We had ordered more than our table of four could accumulate so were moved to a bigger table. Food was served within approximately 20 mins. The food was good, my parents seemed to enjoy the Chinese cuisine and from little of what I tasted i felt the quality was certainly there. My order of tandoori chicken was good but I felt the butter nan to be pretty dry. The owner as well as the manager came around to ask if the food was okay and I let them know of my dry experience of the nan and they immediately changed it. The second batch of nan was much better. Service proved to be admirable and quite helpful when needed. The staff behavior was excellent. All in all it was a great dining experience. A lot of the food we ordered were leftover so we packed it to take home. They gave us a promotional discount but the final bill without the discount seemed reasonable, we were actually expecting the bill to be more but pleasantly surprised. One of the managers actually walked us to our car while leaving. This feeling of exclusiveness felt great and really made you feel the restaurant is keen on delivering good food and service. Hope they are able to maintain this standard in the future. FINAL VERDICT: Location: 9/10 Interior: 10/10 Food: 10/10 Service: 10/10 Price: 9/10",Positive
5425,"On of my favourite resturant, loved the food specially guwalati kabab and veg biryani.... Yummy",Positive
5426,Food was good. Service was great. Most delicious was grilled vetki and tandoori prawn. Kababs were average. Handi biriyani was ok. All other items were good enough. But the mutton nehari needs to improve. Also the shahi tukra was a bit weird. It tasted spicy and sweet both. But it should be sweet only. Kulfi was great. Price is too high. Thank you.,Positive
5427,At first we asked their service man about something spicy from their menu.They suggest to take Kofta biriyani.Taste was worst.We did not find any evidence of spice there.And I don't know why the hell they are taking service charge?Even they did not serve the platter.None of them ask to serve it as well.But papor was good enough as a starter.Decoration was good enough.But disappointed with food.,Negative

In the same vicinity, you get to have exquisite indian cuisines in Tarka, Dhaba, Handi etc with more economical price and good ambiance. Hopefully Lucknow will keep his rivals in mind and improve their cuisines. I don't mind paying much but it's has to be worthwhile.",Negative

5638,"Having a restaurant like this just next to my house is a blessing. We people with friends used to just hang around here & there in searching a good food place with a great environment. Then this is. We have been there consecutively 2 days and tried pizza pasta and french fries. I must say pizza was just delicious. If you can just continue keeping this quality, you will be housefull shortly. Pasta was also good. Cheesy fries wasn't up to the mark I must say. This would be be...tter if you do it by baking in oven. and the flaw I must mention is your service. Waiters are not just accustomed to the typical restaurant service. Try experienced ones. This restaurant will be great place unless you people let the quality be beaten by popularity. :)",Positive

5642,Service is not upto the mark. Food is tasty but the service is poor and after taking order they forgot what we wanted :v,Negative
5643,They took reservation for sehri but when we went there (at 1:15 am) they simply said “we are closed”. They didn’t even bother to inform us regarding this cancellation. Most irresponsible restaurant service I have ever experienced. I wish I could rate them “zero” !,Negative
5645,"The most horrible food i ever had.the mutton torkari was too oily,, piece was small..and the food was not only ordinary bt just totally horrible,i love spice bt it was like the food had no taste ,totally waste of money, Totally Faltu food, rating just 1 out of 10.",Negative
5647,"Those who loves to have ডাল-ভাত along with spicy beef, mutton or chicken, this is the best restaurant for them ! Chui (চই/চুই), the mighty spice that can make you drool anywhere at any moment ! The beef/mutton/chicken pieces where big enough to fill your tummy ! The pulse and the smashed potato are good too. You can choose your own damn meat and very own piece. The service persons are well behaved. Over all a damn cozy place to have lunch or dinner with your beloved ones. Loved it.",Positive
5648,"I visited few days back. The overall environment and decoration is very pale and sub-standard. The plastic chairs and dirty tables, unhygienic washroom and basin area ruined my taste for having food. Nevertheless, I ordered for their beef and mutton. Simply, taste was rubbish. The mutton was stale and just served after warming the mutton cooked the other day. Anyway, more was left for me. When wished to try their chicken, I was told that it was finished though it was 9 pm only. The brinjal fry was burnt and was not edible at all. The dal was simply as good as that served in a street shop. And finally, the rice was of such poor quality that I can't even imagine even to serve this quality rice to my domestic servant. OK, I tried their firni also and I don't wanna say any more. A total wastage of my money. Determined not to visit ever.",Negative
5649,Now the rating is like this because I wasn't able to have food here due to their lack of responsibility. I was planning to go to their Bashundhara branch for sehri and for that I did talk to them a few times to ensure they are open for sehri. Now after going there at 1 AM monday night(Tuesday 1am) I found them closed. When asked they replied they ran out of food that day just after the Iftar and that's why they are closed today. Very unprofessional and hugely disappointing. ... Couldn't you post a note saying that in your FB page!!! What the hell is wrong with you guys!!!,Negative
5650,"For me it was like tasting the flavour I always liked. It was not like what I used to have in Abbas Hotel or in Satkhira or in Khulna Zero Point but its one of the places where the traditional food of Khulna region can be found here in Dhaka. It made me feel nostalgic. So, I have no complain about the environment or service :)",Positive
5651,"The beef was too good today, chicken was good enough but the mutton was not so good....it was so-so. Choi Jhal you should add at least a decent dessert for the ending... The yogurt you served was the worst dish ever and for that the ends taste which left in the mouth was the worst. You should also do something about the mutton.",Positive

Wish You Guys Maintain This Quality InshaAllah.",Positive

5755,"Worst Experience I have ever had. We almost waited for more than 1 hour only for 2 pasta. It was not well cooked. They don't maintain first order first serve basis. Who ordered after us they got their pasta but we didn't. When we asked that waited told us that 'age jeita Ber hoise sheita serve Kora hoise'. I think waiter should know how to provide service. Then they shout to their cook that 'jemon hoise Ber koro'. Every waiter and specially who wear glass should be more professionalism. Personally I won't go think that restaurant to go twice. I would recommend ""Cafe Appeliano"" which is very good in every way.",Negative

U should keep in mind that the price of food should be adjusted according to the quality of the food, quantity of the food. At first u didnt take VAT. But now u take it. I hv no prblm giving it.. But do u realize the price it becomes?? Does it match with the food?? Today I had iftar there.. I m deeply disappointed with everything. I had Fried R...ice with three items.. It was the worst set meal I hv ever had. If i analyse it briefly i will say Food Quality- 2*, Quantity- 1* , Price-1* (300/-) (Excluding VAT). It becomes 345/- total (Without water, Soft drink) .. I just wanna say I love ur place.. Please adjust the price with the quantity.. And also U should watch out about the quality. Its really horrible.. Dont be blew away so early..

5846,"After hearing a massive exaggeration about this place, went there for lunch. We wanted to try tacos but they said it's unavailable. Then we asked about nachos but they told us that it can be provided with beef only so finally we ordered Grind House Special Pizza 6 inches and club sandwich! And later...we repented for our decision....the pizza was burnt and tasted too bitter we couldn't even finish half! It was that horrible...and the sandwich was average...you can get that a...t any usual fastfood shop so I had to fill my tummy with two coca colas...moreover the place was too hot.. we asked why they aren't running their air conditioners and they said it's because of load shedding...come on you should take the necessary step to run one ac atleast! They were playing music on high volume so they could have the facility of running atleast one ac during power cut anyways I'm giving one star for their service...it was the only thing I liked about the place...had the wish to taste their Jambola Pasta but after having the pizza I wanted to run as soon as possible...sorry but greatly disappointed after hearing such high reviews OVERHYPED ! ...

5932,"went there yesterday. First of all, the way of approach was very disappointing. I planned to order student menu, stated on their page. But the waiter said, These are not available now! I asked him to consult it with his manager. He went and came back within a minute and said, they can, but it will take long time. What a strategy to inhibit us to order those set menus as they are relatively cheap in price! After that, I gave feedback to their manager and he said that, there's... The Fried rice was very good with a good smell. The diameter of the glasses were so less that it could held no more than 150-200 ml of soft drink. The last devastating and irritating thing was, they proposed us at least 5 times to give review on Facebook about their food! Why man? Isn't it my choice that I like to give review or not? Do you people have rights to insist? I felt shame that I brought 2 of my friends there. Like others, you people opened up a restaurant to do business and I appreciate that. But, do that with dignity.

5997,3rd class food ever. Offer picture food is not given to me. Amount of the food quantity is low. Also offer price is 598 Taka. So it is a cheap trick to fool us. Food was rotten and it smells bad. Now comes to the service. Their service was extremely bad. Food took 1 hour to receive. Never going there again. Beware everyone don't waste your valuable time and money here.,Negative

There was the bitterness of the chocolate which I liked. The brownie had a crunchy top and it was chewy overall, loved it. Overall it's okay. They are basically selling the same fudge brownie but with a different topping. My only problem is the size. It's not worth the money.",Negative

6093,"Disappointing. Brownies did not taste fresh and of the six different types, each one tasted identical to the next - only the actual toppings (KitKat or Oreo etc) are different, so it's a bit misleading to give them completely different names when they are actually the exact same product. Taste is average. Would not repeat order.",Negative

6240,"Visiting from New York I was skeptical about what I ate. I found this place to extremely hygienic. Being a coffee lover I needed a place where I can grab coffee everyday I tried Gloria jeans and many other but this place serves the satisfying cup of coffee, it is a must have. I also recommend trying the Thai soup and the basil leaf I suggest you ask to put chilies in the sauce, it's a to die for combination with the rice that is slightly sweet. If you're looking for a comfy friendly place to have dinner with it even coffee with friends or family I suggest you come here. Super impressed!!!",Positive

6334,"Had dinner with my family. Ordered appetizer platter, 2sopus, seafood salad, jasmine rice and redcurry. The waiter's behaviour was rather defensive and odd.. No customer services whatsoever. Extremely spicy food despite requesting that we have kids. They need to review their chef and staff",Negative
6336,"The worst Thai food ever! I went there five times to prove myself wrong, but the desi chef consistently served us worst possible food every time. First time I went with a friend and we tried a salad, rice noodle with prawn and finally a coconut ice cream. That was by far the acceptable ones, because we could at least finish eating. We have been fed with the lie that a Thai chef is working in the kitchen, whose big picture is proudly displayed at the entrance! From second time... onwards everything went wrong. Called the manager, who says he is looking into it and never returned. We asked the waiters who also disappeared and never came back. It is the third time we found out that their Thai chef has actually gone on leave two months ago, later found out he left four months ago. The current cook is a Bangladeshi who worked in Bangkok for many years. I am sure he never cooked Thai cuisine for Thai people. Probably worked sat ome desi restaurant in Bangkok cooking desi curries and bhartas! He is your so called “Thai” chef currently preparing all the dishes singlehandedly. My God! Last time we went, we ordered a seafood soup in coconut milk and beef Panama curry. The soup was so sweet that we thought we are having coconut milk sherbet! The beef panang curry was also very sweet. My friend and I were so disappointed that we vouched that we will NEVER COME BACK to Absolute Thai. What an absolute cheating! Be aware!",Negative
6337,"The worst Thai food i have ever had in my life, We order sea food soup, and pad Thai,, Sea food soup was really bad and dont ask about the pad Thai it was horrifying,, Noodels were overcooked, overloaded with sauce, too much sweet, and very raw egg kinda smell.. They told us their chef is from Thailand,... If a Thai chef couldn't cook pad Thai in a right way then who else does!? Maybe that's he couldn't rise up his career in Thailand ���� and came to Bangladesh ��.. The waste of money but our pictures came out really well,, thats the only good thing about this restaurant.��",Negative
6338,"Items were far less, not everything mentioned in the Iftar+Dinner buffet menu was there. When you are paying 1k++ for buffet and get only 18+ items to choose from you at least expect the taste to be spot on, but the food didn't taste good. They couldn't even get the fried rice right�. They claim to be an authentic Thai restaurant but their Pad Thai was the most disappointing dish out of all- It was noodle stirred in a handful of tomato ketchup and egg�. Also, main and desse...rt items were finished by the time we were done with our appetizer and entree. And the most frustrating part of the dinner was the payment. In their facebook post, they mentioned if you pay through certain bank's card you will enjoy 20% discount. So, I decided to pay with my card, which belonged to one of their mentioned banks, but they gave me only 15% discount. When I let them know about their post, they demanded proof-which I showed them on my phone, but still they were firm and rigid on their claim.",Negative
6339,I just had the most amazing experience at Absolute Thai the other day. The Seheri platter is absolutely worth the money. You can have 2 platters only at BDT 850++ and the food is really delicious. Really liked the Chicken Satay and the Prawn Tempura. The Mango sticky rice was a bit weird but really yummy. Way to go Absolute Thai. Going to visit you soon again!,Positive
6340,"The pad thai was basically boiled flat noodle tossed in sauce and scrambled eggs, no bean sprouts or any greens. The mango with sticky rice was horrible with the rice undercooked maybe because the rice was frozen before it was boiled or whatever. Coconut ice cream was ok but too sweet, the only thing good was the tom yam soup but really getting 1 out of 4 dishes taste right is just disappointing.",Negative
6342,"It’s been awhile since I’ve last been here. So, we decided to revisit. And man, how I regret it! The pad thai was so bad and so stinky that we decided to send it back. The only two things that were average was, the fried rice and the red chilli beef. Sea food green curry lacked the flavour and was smelly as well. Fishcake was to rubbery, chicken was basically an overdose of soya sauce. They had only one other table with a family of 5/6 along with us 4, yet my wife literally h...ad to shout “excuse me” to call out the waiter, at least 3/4 times. When I asked about if they had discount for credit cards, the waiter said no with a very straight face till I showed him that EBL signature cards are eligible for 15% discount on ala carte. He went to double check and agreed so. The only thing that probably stood out was they didn’t charge us for the pad thai, which we sent back. It’s really sad to see a restaurant doing so good when they open and only in a matter of time everything deteriorates. Not going back unless they give me free tickets to Thailand!!!",Negative
6344,The stuff are great and friendly. I arranged a birthday there they helped me a lot. Their food is tasty as well. Specially the sticky rice.,Positive
6346,"Food was a bit spicy for my taste, specially in iftar. But overall the experience was good!",Positive
6347,Absolutely pathetic! Worst Thai food I ever had. Quality and taste deteriorated to the lowest level,Negative
6348,"Yes i liked the food. But only thing so far i found totally absurd was the price of the local pepsi can which was 75tk 250ml which must not be more than 40tk highest, i myself buy ""imported"" pepsi or coke for 80tk, so for imported 330ml cans if you put the price over 100tk still i don't mind... but i am not bound to pay local 30-35tk cans for 75tk at least. It has nothing to do with service charge or any other expense, so no excuse please. One or two waiters need to know the basics before packing the left over foods as well.",Positive
6349,"Disappointed � I absolutely (#punintended) love to find faults when I'm at restaurants so that I can bash them on their facebook page. But sadly, their food tasted great and their service was actually nice. Unfortunately, they even replaced my red beef curry when they found out I was allergic to aubergine. I was also highly disappointed by their constantly smiling faces. So with great regret I am giving them 5 stars.",Positive
6350,I thought the seafood with basil leaf was perfect. BEST I’ve had in Dhaka for sure.,Positive
6351,Disappointing food. Ordered 22nd May at 12.01 am; they served 2am. Food was like direct from freezer.,Negative
6352,"The DECOR of the place is absolutely simple. Nothing very fancy or bright, it's aristocratic. Everyone is well behaved & very welcoming. The DISHES we ordered were the almost regular Thai dishes which was served rather quick in different unique pots & plates. The aroma was spot on from every dish, as you put the Soup, soaked dim sim or even fried sea bass in your mouth it would just give you the burst of correct flavours. The PRICES seemed reasonable for 1:3 main dishes, 1:1 appetizers and deserts.",Positive
6353,"Shocking, We tried earlier it was fabulous, this time with friends of early years tried to enjoy but really felt very much disappointed, other than the fish cake and chicken tempura every dish was below par (even it was cold like local Hotel) and finally the so called noodles had to changed after serving,",Negative
6354,"This is my visit to ""Absolute Thai"". I am very impressed to have excellent mouth watering dishes. Ambiance is very nice and service is appreciable. On the other side, price are a bit high. Anyway, I wish Absolute Thai a great success in business.",Positive
6355,Took my family for dinner and availed the 50% off that I won from their contest. I was worried about the quality since a lot of restaurants do not maintain food quality when they offer discounts. Thankfully their quality was top notch. Very satisfactory experience. �,Positive
6356,"Went with a friend for dinner. totally starving after not having had anything to eat the entire day, after shopping. Decided to go for thai food. We arrive around 5ish pm today, there were only 2 tables occupied so of course we expected the service to be fast, but of course that was not the case at all. We ordered thai ice tea, tom yum soup, absolute thai platter, pineapple rice and pad thai. The ice tea too much milk, which ended up really sweet. Tom yum soup was utterly ...disappointing, too much coconut milk. The platter, the only ok, not even good, but ok in it was the fried prawns. The rest was obsolutely rubbish. Pineapple rice was not up to standard at all, the prawn was not fresh at all and the worst of them all which was not even edible and which probably made me and my friend sick was the pad thai, which seemed like it was a left over from yesterday. It had a smell. It was obsolutely rubbish. Worst thai experience i have had. We lost out appetite in the end. We only had a mouthful, paid and left. I felt sick and havent had anything to eat but a chocolate brownie from somewhere else hoping the taste would all be gone and my appetite will get back. But no, my appetite is completely lost. I wouldnt even give this a 1 star! Terrible experience and the service was terrible as well! There were a number of staffs with only 3 tables occupied, including ours however, we had to get up to get the bill as no one came when we called out for anyone! First and last time here. Not worth the time, the food and the money! Dont waste your money! Save the trip! Go somewhere else!",Negative

6416,"Today i had lunch there with some of my friends. The food tasted good as a whole, took Tom yum soup and mixed fried rich with morning glory, chicken hot besil leaf, fish garlic pepper. That was really very nice. Thai lemon mint & lemon grass was simply mouthwatering. Usually for us Bangladeshies, chinese and thai aren't really different. Because we take the cuisine and tailor it in our own way which doesn't leave much of aurhenticity or difference. And we prefer it rather than the original taste as it is spice laced enough to please our tastebud. But, this restaurant lives up to its name and surprisingly the authentic food tastes much much better than our BD style chinese/thai! Overall it was a good experience...",Positive

Then the item Thai Noodle with Prawn was just like eating plastic and was tasteless as well. This fried rice was OK. But the dessert item coconut ice was too much salty. And Mango sticky rice - you never ever going to pay for this awful food. When we called the manager and asked whether you have changed your cook or not? With a gentle smile he answered ''The main cook is going to join from 7th Feb'' I will give you some discount SIR since you did not like the food. Wahhh, what an answer!",Negative

He spills soup while serving and doesn't apologize. He bumps into the table while bringing the main and again doesn't apologize. When I'm billed, I see something in it I didn't even order. Also, the waiters keep hovering around like vultures the whole time as you eat.",Negative

6436,Food was so good..& the interior & service were cool..,Positive
6437,"Food was good... we ordered Prawn fried rice, seafood thai soup, beef with pepper and sweet and sour king prawns... apart from the rice (which was ordinary at best), everything else was good... Now the problems... the king prawns isn't really cheap, so one would expect equal sized prawns... but the restaurant does the same trick many other restaurants do, they give 2 actual king prawns and the other 2 is less than half the size.... our total for the food was 2200, which (if i...t was all inclusive) would have been perfect and amazing, and I'd have recommended it to my friends and would have visited again....however, the 15% VAT and 10% service charge took our total bill to closely BDT 3000... upon close calculation, we realised that the 3:1 rice which was 575 BDT would actually cost 718 including the ++ .... paying 718 Tk for 3 person rice feels ridiculous for even a 3 michellin star studded restaurant... similarly, water costs 65++ (BDT 80)... we went on a weekend and it was almost empty.... and I can understand why... despite the restaurant being really nice, not a lot of people would go there more than once... I hope the restaurant management realizes that and does something about it, because I'd love to go there again if the price becomes reasonable...",Negative

6442,"The worst restaurant ever! The manager should learn how to behave with customers especially how to behave with a lady. We gave reservation for 10 people but unfortunately 2 of us couldn't show up. They charged for 10 people and when we went to argue the manager told me "" i have never been to any good restaurant so i don't know how it works , all the good fancy restaurants take money for each reservation"" and also said many disrespectful things. Never been this offended in my ...entire life. Restaurant is not about food it is also about the customer service. It seems the authority only wants one time customer, and want their customers to get insulted by their mannerless staffs. Its not about money it is about disrespect. Never going there ever , nor will suggest anyone to go. They need to be sued. RUBBISH PLACE TASTELESS FOOD",Negative

6448,Loved the place! One of the best thai food I had recently.. A must try!,Positive
6449,"The food tasted good as a whole, but I didn't like the mixed fried rice; to be very specific, it lacked seasoning, and had lumps of rice, which were not stir fried properly; the overdoneness came from the oozing mix of dark soya sauce. The Seafood Tom tum and chicken in coconut milk soups were tasty, but I've definitely tasted better flavoured ones in Dhaka. The prawn cakes tasted like store bought frozen ones, they were quite rubbery, the chicken satays tasted good. Chicken... with cashew nut, beef chilli and Fish with black pepper sauce were good, but nothing to be over-hyped about, as Dhaka has seen a vast number of restaurants serving Authentic Thai cuisine. The interior and service both were pleasant. I personally feel they still have space for improvement in their cooking techniques. Overall it was a good experience, my family was happy at the end of the day, and that's the most important thing.",Negative

6477,"Just had an Absolute Feast with my family at Absolute Thai! Started off the evening with the Mixed Appetizers which was great while we waited (considering that it was a packed Friday night, it did take time, but also gave us the chance to chat). The food was brilliant, and 3 hours later, I am still full and can barely move. The Coconut soup with Seafood was my personal favourite! Supplemented by the Dim Sum, an item that appeared to be a Thai Fuchka and Thai Fishcakes dipped... in a Creamy Garlic Sauce, it was a great opener. We ordered loads of items but the Pad Thai, Red prawn and the Chicken with Green Curry particularly stood out. We ended the evening with the (sweet) Lemon Grass juice and the infamous Sticky Rice with Mango (which really lived upto its hype). The restaurant itself is cozy, comfortable, illimunaited and has a classy feel without trying hard. This place is a must for anyone looking for fine dining with quality Thai food.",Positive

6483,"Absolute Crap. Almost walked out after having an excuse of a fish cake, 'mama piaju' would've fared better. Somehow restrained myself to give the rest of the foods a chance. But alas, none of the foods looked appetising to start with; the rice & noodle were too sweet & the curries were salty. I didn't quite get from which angle this was Thai cuisine apart from some Thai spices & vegetation randomly thrown in. And apparently the chef is Thai. Well, I can imagine he was probably found selling Thai mama piaju on the streets of Thailand. Worst Thai food experience.",Negative

Best wishes for Spaghetti Jazz.... Suggesting the authority to keep some options of online payment system like Dmoney, Ipay, Upaye etc for hassle-free and secured online payment system of bill payment.... We the employees of Dmoney and Square Group wish to pay the bill with Dmoney Account instantly. Cash transaction is too much main stream & hazard full to us. Best wishes from Zaman, Dmoney Bangladesh Ltd.",Positive
6528,"Entered Spaghetti Jazz at roughly 2.45pm after calling them up to find out if they were open and where exactly the restaurant was. They asked us to order fast as they we gonna stop the kitchen operations at 3pm. We ordered 2 mushroom steaks. They were quick to serve the food. The grilled vegetables were good. Mashed potato was a little dry. Steak was dry and chewy. Mushrooms tasted bland. The waitress kept on hovering around us and handed the bill over to us not even halfway through the meal. She insisted we pay up the bill then mentioning that they were going to go on a break. At no point were the waiters/wiatresses cordial with us. Their attitude was outright impolite. We should have been notified on arrival that they were going to have a soft-close at 3 and wouldn't be able to serve us then. We would have been alright with that and left. Instead, they served us overcooked steaks and provided us the worst service I've experienced since 2013. To the Management: I am sorry but your steak was overpriced considering the quality and you really need to hire new staff. Alternatively you can also remove the service charge from your prices and make your employees work for the tip, who now get it regardless of how they treat your customers. The two stars I have given you is because of the grilled vegetables and the positive attitude of the guard with the beard; the only good things about our experience at SJ today. This is a very constructive criticism, please take note of it.",Negative

Overall impression good for foodies who want more foods at a lower price.,Positive

We asked about the phone call we made previously . They said the guy who received it didn't know about the issue ! Seriously ! This isn't expected from tradition bd. Only good quality food won't serve your business well. Please fill up the communication gap. Previously I recommended many people to go there. But I won't be doing so any more..",Negative

At last our kids feeling embarrassed, how more we should asking for our desired items , rather they come again with crab. Simply Cheating with us even I start shouting they don't feel to say sorry....rather they insist us to start main dishes of buffet. They blundered our dinner , where our relatives from USA, Australia stop taking food . We must insist anybody not to go there to spoil their launch / Dinner ... Food is not only a food ...where enjoyment ruined by the tricky cheating business policy.",Negative
6735,"Probably the best buffet restaurant for dinner in Dhanmondi in terms of food quality and variety, price and ambience with a few small shortcomings that you'd do well to be prepared for. The buffet begins at your table with ""starters"" i.e. the day's bbq served at your table - chicken, fish and mutton with naan, which is refilled as you finish the serving. Although the waiters claim that the starters are ""un-limited"", after you've asked for a refill twice, service slows down an...d the waiters begin to discourage you from asking for more refills by repeatedly telling you that the bbq is only a starter and that you can now try the main buffet. It might get annoying, but as I found out, it's not bad advice since the buffet is quite good. The main dishes aren't the same old buffet dinner fare you see over and over again, but different and tasty. Their chicken biryani, creamy chicken and lemon fish in particular were really good. The chicken soup and chicken basil leaf were a little too salty though. The others - onion prawn, shahi paneer, beef etc were good. Among their deserts, their shahi tukra and brownie were good while the others - bread pudding, firni, fruit etc were just plain. However, they also serve kulfi! It wasn't out of the world, but hey - it's kulfi! Overall, definitely a place I'd recommend for dinner. And if you take my advice - don't try to get all your money's worth from the bbq alone; save it for the buffet, it's worth it. P.S. the menu changes from day to day, and so might your experience there.",Positive
6737,"This is my second visit to the restaurant. I went there for lunch. This time i found little poor service. The bbq they served on table was only limit to chicken, fish and pineapple. After the second serve of bbq the waiters were rushing us to start buffet. When we started buffet the waiters where rushing to cleanup and to serve desserts. This is very annoying. In main course they have very limited items including beef biryani. As i don't eat beef the option became more less for me. But overall still i am satisfied.",Negative
6739,"The table BBQ (i loved it), after serving two or three times they seemed disturbed and impatient to serve more and almost forces us technically to go towards the main dish. Main dish is rubbish comparing to quality and quantity with other buffet restaurant.

6754,"I been there with my whole family. No welcome drinks. No place for kids. The kabab they offered were too salty and only 3 types. And tasted so bad. Along with it they gave “nun” which was so hard that it was hard for us to chew. Then we had the “main course “. None of the food was mouth watering. They didn’t have any sort of mutton, any appetisers with soup. No pasta, no chawmin, beef and prawns were not edible of eating. More over prawns were smelling they weren’t cleaned we...ll. About dessert I didn’t feel like having any of them else than fruits. Anyone who would dine there once won’t go there again. And someone who loves food should not go there.

6808,starters was really good....main course was so so....and I didn't like the dessert at all except pudding..... overpriced.... items should be expanded at this price.... ambience was really good....waiters were helpful....,Negative

6814,It's wonderful. Fantastic experience. I loved it. Food was excellent.,Positive
6815,Number of items need to increase. Food supply is not good. Mutton kabab supply was intentionally poor. Should not taste Biriyani Beef.. its just waste of money. In my opinion it can not be a buffet restaurent.,Negative
6816,"Very well decorated. Excellent service. Food was just awesome. Finely organised. In one word,, Loved the place and foods.",Positive
6817,It should include more dishes in its main course. Serving needs to be a bit more prompt,Positive

So suggestions for all, can go and enjoy the mouth watering foods.",Positive
6823,Foods are so tasty,Positive
6824,The grill items were good . Specially their prawns. But they should improve the number in their buffet items. And they should improve their biryani ! A lil change will definitely improve their customers i believ!,Negative
6825,The food is good. But the refilling time of kababs at the table should be more fast. Awesome place for fine family dining and superb interior.,Positive

One more thing those people who serve BBQ they shows they too disturb to serve us more Two or Three time, is it a business policy? I want to say if you guys don't have ability to give proper service then why? Please do what you can, we spend our money to get better service . You guys have excellent and delicious food but with poorest service.",Negative

6835,Worth going on ......again and again .................Delicious items in an awesome atmosphere .........Liked it and hope you will too ...............,Positive
6836,Good ambiance with sumptuous meal...I found it very interesting. Their main dishes including dessert items are mostly Indian style. Found variety in offering salads and papradum added unique value in their menu. Enjoyed variety of kebabs and kulfi ..too good�. Haven't seen any noodle item but Hot gelapi...umm...mouthwatering..overall I think it's worthy for a family dine as well as small g2g. Would like to visit their again ..,Positive
6837,"Liked their bbq. Other courses are okay. Expecting some improvements, changes and addons in main courses and desserts and a bit wide varieties in bbq section. Hope they'll revamp their menu plan keeping this quality.",Negative

6844,"খাবার ভালো, পরিবেশ সুন্দর। দাম একটু বেশী। বিকাল ৪টার পর এরা AC, লাইট সব বন্ধ করে দেয়। আমাদের চায়ের অর্ডার এরা ঠিকই serve করছে কিন্তু ওনাদের সময় পার হয়ে যাওয়ায় AC, LIGHT বন্ধ করে দিছে। আরো কয়েকটা জায়গায় buffet party করেছি কিন্তু এরকম rude ব্যবহার পাইনি। তাই কারো যদি বন্ধুদের নিয়ে সময় নিয়ে আড্ডা মারতে ইচ্ছা হয়, avoid this place.",Negative
6845,"Good variety of starters and main courses, but limited variety of desserts. Probably the best dining option in that area, which is quite important given the traffic in Dhaka. Only the buffet option is available, which is not convenient if you want to order something specific for a smaller amount, but overall the value for money is quite adequate. Drinks are not included in the buffet price.",Positive
6846,"Cold skewered meat, bland food, worst mixed vegetables I've ever had (literally felt like I was chewing on wood chips soaked in gravy), dry pasta, something that they called fish (not sure what kind of fish was that, as a seafood lover and as someone who traveled to distant places for good fish, I felt offended by the fish dish). I'm not sure why people gave it such high ratings. Spent time with a lot of loved ones, that was the highlight of the visit, certainly not the food. Never going there again even if someone paid me to go there.",Negative
6847,"Excellent food, beautiful interior, outstanding service.",Positive
6848,not much food items.. starter was good but there is less food item in main course that's really dissapointing :/,Negative
6849,I loved their starter and desert!! ��� way too good.....!!!,Positive
6850,"It was nice, felt like an overseas buffet restaurant. The built-in BBQ grill table with unlimited kebabs is their main attraction. For starters, they served chicken boti, mutton shish, fish, Indian paneer & potato kebabs. I loved the chicken kebab most, it was well marinated with yogurt and spices. Other than that, they had chicken corn soup, papadums, chutneys & lots of salads. The main course had a rather small but good selection of dishes. The Hyderabadi biryani was nice b...ut the meat wasn't tender enough and it was made from ""mixed cuts"". I also liked the beef chili (bhuna), fish with lemon grass, prawn with tomato & basil and shahi paneer (similar to korma). There were only four dessert items with unlimited kulfi. The buffet price (Tk.1200) doesn't include VAT or any drinks. Overall, it would be better if they could include mutton boti kebab for starters and expand the menu for main course & dessert items.",Positive
6851,"Arrangements were good but service could be better... as we went for a buffet dinner, I found less items as desert.... There could be more main dishes... Truly speaking, I was not impressed....",Negative

6883,"From the outside it doesn't look much but its a different story once you step inside. Quite well decorated with comfortable sitting arrangements. Went there first time during for Iftar + dinner. The highlights of the menu were the whole lamb, whole fish, lasagna and teriyaki chicken. The lamb was well marinated and soft, while the fish was also equally marinated. The lasagna was exceptionally good specially for a buffet Iftar menu. One other thing which I liked was the live grilling station serving minute steaks, prawns and grilled mackerels. The staff were quite attentive, quickly clearing out our plates during the buffet and checked with us if food was ok or if we need anything else. Hope they can keep up the level of quality and service",Positive
6885,"Let’s talk about service: in one word awesome, the quality of food was really good and mouthwatering. The environment was really nice. I liked the BBQ part it’s really well cooked and juicy. Must visit this place for their quality food, hospitality and environment. Shaw's Steakhouse has already won acknowledgements and certifications for it’s quality food, service & environment. Wish them all the very best in future.",Positive
6886,"First thing that i look when i reach an eatery is a parking spot, even though Shaw is located near a very busy exit but their outdoor personnel efficiently managed and secured me a good parking spot. The decor and the ambience is very luxurious but entering the place made me feel awkward as i found the restaurant staffs (waiters) themselves sitting at guest chairs and watching TV. They couches are very cozy to sit but i also think they congested the place with too much sittin...g arrangement. They should have left more free space for free movement even though they have such a big floor. Their food quality is excellent, the steaks were perfectly marinated and cooked to perfect flavors and temperature, the taste and the look shows that dishes are cooked delicately here. However the portion is the issue!! I think the servings are not adequate, even the pictures taken of the food on the plate looks poor. I think the main courses served should have the standard portion Quantity that any other fine dining offers. The Manager was a very nice gentlemen. And the waiter who served us was also very attentive and gentle. Also charging 15Tk only for the bottled water was cool !!",Positive
6887,"I was always bit confused when someone asked me, which is the best steak place in city. now i can proudly say.. shaws steak is the best place to have steak. best ambience, best food, best service.",Positive
6889,"If I go for honest reviews I am a die hard steak fan.. for which I keep on experimenting trying steaks at different places, wont go into direct comparison but I can assure you their steaks and dessert are the best out there. Point to be added this is the perfect place for well off dinner. Need a second visit out there :) Ambiance:9/10 Quality:8.5/10 Service:10/10 Price: good things cost you a bit",Positive
6891,"Went there with high expectation. The appetiser was okay but the main dishes were pathetic. There was some smell coming out from the steak and didn’t like the flavour at all. Also we complained about it to the manager and he gave us complementary desserts which also tasted smelly. The presentation was good, service was good but sadly the food taste was not up to the mark. It is an expensive food place so it is normal for customer like us to expect that high quality and value for money we are paying. Hope they will improve and give us the chance to say something good in the future!",Negative
6893,"Each and every food item was extraordinary.... really awesome, keep it up guys. Thanks a lot for your warm hospitality and fast service.",Positive
6895,One of the best place for steaks and seafood in Dhaka. It's a must try for any steak or seafood lover.,Positive
6896,Absolutely amazing place to dine out with the special one! I actually took the right decision to take my bf for his birthday surprise lunch.. the food was perfect the ambience was Amazing..the waiters were amazing and last but not the least .. the GM came up to us personally and made sure we had a great time .. He was so humble and friendly .. I would love to visit that place again and again! Good luck for the future..hope you continue with your service and food quality just like this �,Positive
6897,Amazing food and amazing service. Can't thank Nibedita Apu enough for suggesting this amazing place and making my evening so special. We ordered a Porterhouse Steak which was made to perfection but what surprised me the most is the chicken mushroom piccata. Can't even explain how good it tasted.,Positive
6898,"Worst iftar cum dinner offer ever, went there with high expectations but was seriously disappointed by the food quality and specially the so called “steak”. Is that what you call steak? Totally a deceiving place and severely overpriced",Negative
6899,"Service was OK. Didn't like the food though. The manager said it's on the French taste side but as we've never been to France nor could we validate that, neither could we enjoyed their sauces with sweet taste!! In one line: If someone is up for Continental dishes with a touch of sweetness, please do explore them.",Negative

6903,It was our first visit. Service is very good. But when it comes to food it was utter disappointment. We asked for medium done steak. But it was literally raw with blood. They took it thrice for cooking it again. Price is on the higher side and alternatives are there. Didn’t like the steak that much. You need to improve massively if u want to stay in competition.,Negative
6904,The best steak and seafood in Dhaka. Norwegian Salmon and my NY Strip Steak was out of the world. And their lobster thermidor and stuffed mushroom was a best bet. Coming every week Shaw’s.,Positive
6905,We didn't know what to expect when we made our reservations. The food was absolutely delicious. The steaks were very buttery � and similar taste to those you find in the States. Highly Recommend as they cater to your every request. The staff was friendly and professional.,Positive
6906,If anyone is up for steak 🥩 should try out Shaw’s. They changed the whole game plan for steak,Positive

Needed to be a little crispier. তাই বইলা পোতানো মুড়ির মত ছিলনা, it was okay. Mayo served along was simply great, better than what I got inside the burger in fact. Could improve the sitting a little though. And it's pretty confusing to find it in-between stores with similar outlook. Or আমি চমশা পরি দেখে খুইজা পাইতেসিলামনা, who knows!!! :P Overall a very good experience, 'Burger-wise'. Definitely recommended for burger lovers. Cheers!!!",Positive

I saw a boy coming with ...a plate having rice and a small piece of chicken no salad and no chinese vegetable!!! I wondered when I asked why its like this he said that vegetables are not available. the worst thing is when I told that I bought a guest with me why u guys insulting me.The waiter told me to manage..Waiters don't have slightest concern for customers. They just move around they don't care at all and the person who took the order he was mad about to go home and when looking for him to answer he was not there already left.who was in cash he took full bill and even did not ask me anything.Awfully he asked extra money for drinks.I never imagined take a bite is giving this worst service now a days.

Recently they have been serving less quantity and they dont even care about making salad and guess what after complaining over phone they started making more mess. Now the quantity is twice lesser than before and time of delivery has gone up twice too! You were so good before!,Negative
7351,Had the fried rice offer few days back and they were so good! rice was plenty with well seasoned wings( Though it wasn't spicy enough for naga wings).

Please try to serve all the food at a time. Otherwise, we customers get confused. ""Where is my French fry? Where is my coke?"" :p Anyway, best of luck guys. Will be there again.",Positive

7523,"Hands down, worst pasta I've ever eaten. I'd go one step further and say It's probably the worst fast food I've eaten ever. Pizzas found in Cha Birir tong with a price tag of 25 taka taste much better than this. I ordered a naga baked pasta. It had 70% rubber, 29.99% oil and 0.01% chicken. Not even a single molecule of cheese. Literally there was nothing that can resemble anything close to cheese. There were in total 3 microscopic pieces of chicken. Taste: 0/10... Price: -inf / 10 ( I was charged 239 taka for this piece of crap. ) I get that it can be hectic before iftar and quality of some items might fall. But what I was delivered, was simply garbage. Unless someone's dying of hunger, s/he dare not touch this abomination.",Negative

7531,"Well i have have visiting this place a lot for last one year but today they just ruined every interest. Probably i wont be coming here again. First of all AC does not work properly and no fan is there. Secondly management is not strong enough and the rules for entering smoking zone is absurd. The smoking zone was supposed to be off limits till iftar and half an hour before Magrib, some couple rushed inside taking their backs and plates and waiters were just standing still. Thirdly, it’s Ramadan and unlike other restaurants they dont serve their set meals, absolutely weird. And lastly, They served me drinks � 5 mins after Magrib Ajaan. -_-",Negative

7688,"Talk about taste, items and environment … Pasta State nails. But they've got one bad side. One and only. They are often late to serve nowadays. Possibly they're late because of the huge number of the customers. Personally, I don't see it as a sin or anything. Overall, Pasta State is one of my favorites. But they should be even better.",Positive
7689,"Went to Pasta State Dhanmondi to have unlimited Pasta.... I had buffet and Unlimited meals at least 30-40 times in the last few years but this wast the worst unlimited offer.... Here's a short review~ So when I was entering the restaurant a guy was going out , he came back 1 minute after that and complained that a cockroach came out from his Pizza Box � I saw the cockroach too.... Kinda lost my appetite there... They probably changed his pizza after that. After that we were w...aiting and the electricity went off, The whole restaurant was for at least 15 minutes so I am guessing they don't have a generator. Finally they served the pastas 20 minutes before Iftar... it was looking good to be honest... So after azan we started eating and the next experience is horrible... There was only cheese top layer... they just mixed mayonnaise with some boiled pasta and topped it with a lil bit of cheese and served it... At least 1/5th part of the bowl was full of oil � I ate 20 huges slices of pizza in another restaurant last week so eating 5/6 bowls or atleast 3 bowls of Pasta is nothing for me... My friend didn't even try another bowl... I went for a second one and they said they don't have any more bowls to serve the pastas so they started serving in take away containers.... Btw ALL of the plates and bowls were broken (the edges) I couldn't even finish the second one... so I requested a waiter to pack it up for me so I can give it to someone on the street since it's Ramadan we shouldn't waste food � They packed it up.... Almost everyone took their pasta in parcel because they couldn't finish it... (though it was an unlimited offer) They are serving their ""Special Baked Pasta"" only with Coke/Sprite~ Price : 345tk (including everything) Taste : 2/10 � Environment : 5/10 Service : 5/10 I won't even recommend my enemy to go and take this order � Really disappointed~",Negative

My pasta was suppose to have beef in it and when I asked about the waiter about this, they told me they ran out of beef (!!) .The pasta was a huge disappointment. It seemed to be made of more soft flour than hard durum wheat, which resulted in pasta that made a flour-like gravy when combined with wet ingredients.

I just couldn't make any time, until today. :( :) I looked up the food places near Taj Mohol road, Dhaka on Google maps, and it was the same old same old, BFC/KFC/Pizza Hut BS. I didn't want to go to any of them. I wanted to try some place new. As I kept searching a little marker stood in one far north-west corner of the map. It read Bell Pattio. I called my student and we met up nearby, only t...o be greeted by an exhausted employee in a small lone, gloomy room of a restaurant. I wondered all the time whether they actually served anything at all. The exhausted employee asked us if we wanted the works, to which we simply replied ""sure"". The Pizza arrived in 10min. It was the fastest pizza order I ever received in town. And it was superb! I recommend all to come here at least once if not more, in their lifetime. 5/5",Positive

The pizza arrived in 15-18 mins, piping hot. It was the kind of pizza one would find at a restaurant like Pizza Hut, which was a pleasant surprise. It does say ""Beef and Chicken"" in the pizza description but they came in sausage form and not their usual form. This was a bit unusual but not a bad idea. The dough was fresh, there was a good amount of cheese, the service was good, and the price was very very reasonable. I hope they continue doing what they're doing because it's working. I hope to visit them once again soon.",Positive
7841,Pizza not as described in the menu. I ordered two different pizzas. Surprisingly both looked and tasted the same. :/ They used the local Dhaka cheese instead of Mozzarella on the crust.

7900,Worst restaurant ever in the restaurant history of my life...2 hours passed by but they still couldn't serve 2 pizzas of 12inch...what theee....kichu bllm na just..,Negative
7901,"Chicken Steak with Rice (This offer is not available now) Price : 239 + vat Although this offer is not available now I am posting this if it again pops up. The food was indeed what was shown on the promo photo by Bunkers Khilgaon. Mostly the place was humble enough to let us celebrate our friend's birthday. The hospitality we got was indeed astonishing. So if you guys are finding it hard to get a decent place to have some quality time with your friends and family. I would re...ally recommend you Bunkers �. Pasta Basta Price : 350 + vat It was another meal I had there. One of the best pasta basta in khilgaon I ever had. The two layer pasta was full of chicken and beef. If you are a pasta fan I would really ssuggest you to go there and try this. Lastly we went up there without any previous reservation, so if you guys are planning on going there please do call them or inbox them before you go there.",Positive
7902,Definitely a place to hangout with your friends and family. Good quality food with affordable price range on the menu. Supported by great service by the staff.,Positive
7903,"Worst service.. They had only three tables to cover.. They somehow managed that to look like a rush.. Took more than one hour to serve simple oven baked pasta which by the way was blunt and creamy. The chicken steak oregano tasted good but the quantity and the price don't match at all. Set menu was average with very unpleasant decoration.. But coming back to my first point, if you guys can't serve anything within a given time please do have the decency to accept it and tell us on the face. People who came late and ordered late got their foods served but others had to wait for no apparent reason ! Customers don't want 10% honour or whatsoever for your lousy service.. Never going back to your place and obviously not recommending it to others.. but then again with so many customers in your grasp a lousy review doesn't matter anyway.",Negative

8020,"During last Saturday, I had Iftar cum dinner buffet at Bunkers. So guys, I am reviewing on the basis of only this; do not relate this with any of their regular platters. I had only tasted what was offered in that buffet menu. THE WORST BUFFET EVER I EXPERIENCED !!!... I am not writing this on anger. I let myself cool down, waited for than two days and were thinking where that went wrong; now reviewing. 1. If a restaurant offers buffet, it should be only buffet. No other regular platter should be offered during that time span. That creates a mess. They were offering buffet with every other regular platters. Hence, there place wasn't well designed and stuffs were not properly trained to handle such mayhem. 2. They offered around 30 items and to refill one dish we had to wait like 10 to 15 minutes; standing in a line. If you don't have enough structural setup and expertise to handle a house full of guests, why you guys offer buffet? 3. There were shortage of food. Usually people have spring roll with soup. They were refilling soup but spring roll was vanished; literally vanish after first round. When I asked, they replied (শেষ হয়ে গেসে ভাইয়া, সরি). What nonsense is that? Do you guys even know what buffet means? 4. And there was an item of chicken covered with sauce (I forgot the name). That was good. I could grab 3 pieces and yet again, never refilled. According to their menu, they should have an item of beef, haven't seen it. A guest from the next table said that they gave a new dish, spicy chicken; I went and an empty plate was there. I complained and probably the store manager said (স্যার, দিয়ে তো কুলাতে পারছি না, দেয়ার সাথে সাথেই শেষ হয়ে যাচ্ছে). Dear that person, let me apologize for my language, but are you stupid? Do the math. Count the number of ovens you have, number of cooks in there, stuffs you have, estimate your food preparation pace, understand how many guests you can handle and over buffet for 5 less than that number. If you cannot cope up with the pace even once, you should be really really sorry. 5. And, now comes the topic of mighty PIZZA. Pizza wasn't included in the buffet menu they showed me but they were offering it. WORLD'S THINNEST PIZZA, I MUST SAY! :P Everyone must go and have a look; really astonishing. 6. Buffet time was till 9PM and most of the dishes were vanished around 7.45PM. People were starting to leave and around 8PM I left with the worst buffet experience in my life.",Negative

8235,"Last Friday we planned to dine out and headed to Pizza Hut at Dampara, Chittagong. We ordered for a large size cheesy bite pizza with chicken & other expected toppings, baked chicken pasta, fried button mushroom and cream of chicken soup. We were really shocked to find just a few tiny chunks of chicken as part of the toppings over the so-called pizza. Cream of chicken soup was also nothing special. By pouring little cream on a typical glutinous soup, you can't name it cream o...f chicken soup for your very kind information. Trust me, I had much better baked pasta at Da Signature in Chittagong and Shawarma House in Dhaka. Your baked pasta was awefully gravy when the cheese layer was taken off the top. Are you guys making money in Bangladesh by fooling innocent hard-working people down here? Are you ripping us off by using the brand ""Pizza Hut""?",Negative
8237,"I order almost 2-3 times a week from Pizza Hut PHD Dhanmondi. I order pizza all the time but unfortunately I ordered the chicken mushroom pasta today which happens to be the worst pasta I ever had. No trace of white sauce, the use of slightly roasted onions was so much that it made me wonder if the main ingredient was pasta or onion. You guys just packed me a box full of garbage! Picture in the comment section!",Negative
8239,"Pizza hut is a international chain restaurant. But in Bangladesh I don’t think it’s official anymore, because the service, food and environment wasn’t like that what it is used to be 5 years back. Me and my wife went last monday the waiter who took our order was stupid. Soup was cold and they are literally cleaning the sealing even people are eating. Well bla bla bla bla. Transcom company should shut it off.",Negative
8241,"we are dedicated pizza hut customers for long,we normally order online.During Eid holidays my husband ordered a pizza, which was not upto the mark. He just took the online survey and mentioned about it. after that, the awesome customer service is just chasing us for giving us the complementary pizza!!!today they had sent a pizza and the delivery person was apologising in a row for our previous experience. This was a whole new customer service experience for us.Keep it up Pizza Hut!",Positive
8243,Seeking attention to the higher authority! Just been to baily road branch and the food was aweful. Specifically the topping and cheese were smelly on top of that waiter took my order wrong and over charged me so I complained and they kept me waiting while getting the numbers right. I left a complain feedback but I doubt whether it will reach to the higher authority ever. Disgraceful overall!,Negative
8245,"Good God! After enjoying meals in Pizza hut across the world all my life, I took my boy out during the school break for a treat. He ordered the ""special"" pizza... which turned out to be nothing remotely like what we're used to. Listen, seriously, I know this is Bangladesh and all and you're trying to cater to the native palate but **you don't have to**... pizza hut is now off our list of places (for me and my wife and my son - hat-trick - perfect) because of this monstrosity they served us. If I wanted a Bengali pizza from an American chain (on home ground), I'd head down to my local Habib Hotel and order their curry and rice. It was hideous. The product development team need to stick up a reminder on their desks, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" Meanwhile, I shall be taking my wallet somewhere where I get a pizza when I order one.",Negative
8247,"I ordered pizza by Food panda. the worst ever i eat. this is iftre time guys. my family didn't told me anything. they send me two pizza. it was buy 1 get 1 free offer. but there is no cheese (what we expected). bread was too much dry. after the iftar, in night i baked extra slice in oven and what??? it looks same as a ""pauruti"" with some onion :( ...sorry pizza hut. please do something good, because you have good reputation in pizza. :( sorry for poor rating.",Negative
8249,"To the authority, I have been a dedicated customer of Pizza Hut for more than 5 years. Your pizzas and service has always intrigued me. However, recently I have seen you charge high ""exclusive"" VAT and Tax rates for the products. For example, you are charging VAT and Tax for buying soft drinks from your outlets at high rates (BDT132/- VAT+Appl SD for Cheese Lovers and one Mirinda worth BDT 548/- total). Another case: BDT 104/- VAT+Appl SD for a meal worth BDT 699/- I want to know the reason behind this increase. Regards, A Dedicated Customer of Pizza Hut who is loosing faith in the services of the brand.",Negative
8251,"Alhumdulillah! Had a wonderful time at pizza hut gulshan 1 today. We arranged an iftar party for 60 orphans there in a reasonable price n the staff n service were genuinely warm n helpful.

8253,Please make sure that all yours outlets have the actual real offers. And updated all the offers at the web. And do not make people Harris and at list try to keep your company reputation well. Thanks,Negative
8255,Today I tried the chicken arrabbiata pasta from your Bashundhara outlet. The pasta was absolutely disgusting! I know it is not right to criticize food this way but the food you served tasted so bad. Such a waste of money. There was no cheese and the pasta was undercooked. No wonder this particular outlet is always empty.,Negative
8257,"I want to thank pizza hut chittagong CDA Ave (near bus stop) for extraordinary service. We were travelling from CTG to Dhaka. We ordered a pizza and said that our bus will leave in 5 mins, can u make it? They said they ll deliver if they cant. So time ran out and our bus was leaving, so we hurriedly went for the bus and asked them to cancel the order. Our bus started and we were upset that pizza hut couldn’t provide our food. Suddenly the bus stopped and a pizza hut delivery guy came in with our pizza. We were shocked! He chased the bus to deliver our pizza. This shows amazing customer service from them. Thank u again and special thanks to the delivery guy.",Positive
8259,"With no doubt I love your pizza a lot.. bt I dont Understand why pizza hut charging 132++ to buy a soft drinks. its too high man. In other Countries its so cheap then why Bd pizzahut is so Expensive. My suggestion prince is maximum 50 per glass or you can provide Can. Regards, A pizza lover in your shop. Thank you.",Positive
8261,"Worst unlimited pizza offer ever. You have to order everytime and wait 15 mins for pizza to come. They serve medium sized 1 pizza everytime, which takes less than 2 mins to finish. This is pure rubbish. Please stay away from this trap. Waste of money.",Negative
8263,Simply marvellous their efforts to satisfy their customers. On 9th April I ordered a triple chicken stuffed crust pizza and got dissapointed. But when I shared my bad experience with them they not only noticed it but made it a pleasant memory by delivering another meal with their signature taste and supreme quality. Hats off to their customer feedback. It feels great to know that someone really cares about you. Keep it up,Positive
8265,Worst pizza in their BOGO offer. Thickest crust with the thinnest topping. It was totally worthless. After eating it seemed like I bought 2.5k worth of bread n sauce. Go and die pizza hut,Negative
8267,I went to the Mirpur 1 outlet seeing their latest offer. The guy there said the have run out of the specific pizza. I mean why do you put an offer if you can't serve your customers? Why do you do business in the first place?,Negative
8268,I simply don't like their pizza. It doesn't have the x factor. It's just usal pizza and the price is not reasonable at all specially compared to the taste.,Negative

8270,Very nice place with tasty pizza.....,Positive
8271,I need a lower star rating to rate this place. When pizza hut came to bangladesh it was simply the place to be. But now its ruined by unprofessional uneducated staff who dont even know how to talk to customers. And the quality of food has degraded drastically. I remember i used to love them so much i went there at least once every 2 weeks. Not anymore.,Negative

Called them nearly 8:35 pm for placing an order , 1st receiver told me to call after 9:00 pm as they can't TAKE order then! Who does that? Anyways, next Time I called, they told me that they can't delivery to Jigatola. Was surprised! I told him that I ordered from my present address before. He said it's impossible to deliver to... my address and hung up! After today's experience I was feeling like showering the Pizza Hut delivery management team with all the galis I know:) On which basis Pizza Hut recruits those bloody idiots who don't even know how to serve their customer? How to talk to them? Never expected this, Pizza Hut can be so damn unprofessional!!!!!!!!!! If you can't deliver to a certain area you must announce that! Never ever going to place an order from them .",Negative

Currently no one knows the actual status of its international franchisee license and clearly they don't care about the quality of food anymore.

As many good competitors have risen up now, you don't have to eat the DRY, RUBBERY pasta, and TASTELESS, generic pizza they serve, not anymore.

On just a small note I do think the onions are kind of a little turn off, but not much big of a deal. And the MiCasa sauce could be just a little less watery, but then again didn't keep me out. Money well spent. Keep this up and in no time you could be amongst the top pizzas in town. Edit: Order was delivered 20 minutes earlier than given time. Amazing punctuality. (Y)",Positive

8548,"I ordered an Italian Deep Dish pizza tonight through HungryNaki. It was supposed to be 12"" but it seemed smaller, but I didnt whip out a scale to measure. There was no Beef ham, Bacon, Pepperoni, Onion or Capsicum. The depth of the bread was not filled, essentially making it a non deep dish pizza. The marinara was salty and the cheese was stringy. It might be the worst pizza I have ever had. Funny thing is the quality wasnt this bad before, they had a pretty amazing deep dish pizza. But what I got tonight, I wouldnt even feed my dog. Pathetic.",Negative
8550,I didnt like the ambience and their ac didnt work at all it was all warmed up and the damn waiter said it was in 16 degree !!! Actually it was in 25 degree ( with heat mode) along with the spicy pizza !! And the waiter didnt serve me at all ! It was unlimited offer we took but he served me only 2 slices!!! He didnt have the decency to offer me any 3rd slice !! He served all of them in the same table not me! I didnt bother to ask him ! He was an idiot ! The money is not worth it at all I will not recommend anyone to visit you guys again.,Negative

Had their fried rice too which they have placed as appetizer and it actually is properly put as the rice would not make you full but make you salivate and hanker for more. Overall had a very good experience.",Positive
8558,I am giving 3.5for the taste of the deep dish pizza and for the fast delivery . It was very tasty but I don’t know why the crust was too burnt.

Some of us waited 10 min for spoon, I had to ask 5 times to serve drinks and got after 15 min when we all done eating!! Manager challenged us at the time of bill... and didnt learn how to deal/talk to customers/guests- we had a guest below 10 years who is supposed to get 50% billed but Manager claims she is around 12 years old. (how mean! -in that case shall we keep birth certificate?) Overall experience is very bad! > Food - 1/5 > Environment - 0/5 > Service - 1/5 (if u cant manage the crowd/customers/food/restaurant, better u close it!)",Negative

I was there with friends and each time my friends wanted to order something, the waiter countered asking them to order someone else. For example, a friend ordered Thai chicken, and the waiter said to order grilled chicken. Another friend ordered chicken pizza and the waiter said to order seafood pizza. These are just 2 examples. The entire fiasco went for more than 15 minutes. And the waiter wasn't even suggesting alternatives. He was blatantly saying, no try the other one. I was extremely pissed with the service and never going back there again.",Negative

For about 700tk we got 4 tiny pieces of stuff chicken. Totally not worth it. The ravioli, seafood soup, grilled chicken & lemon mint soda were really good though.

The staffs took order from us 5 times as anything we ordered was unavailable, as they went on asking the chefs I think. Finally we managed to order something. Then they kept us waiting for too long time. They even forgot half of our order. Also we ordered wrapped swarma and they claimed we ordered arabian swarma. This type of hazardous experience we had. Quality and quantity does not meet up to the pricing. Food is very much over priced. Moreover place is cozy and uncomfortable. They were not professional at all. I'd not recommend this place.",Negative

Both the pizzas were cold, dry,rubbery and the taste wasn't good at all. The margharita pizza lacked basil leaves which doesn't make it a margharita pizza. And price wise the Corleone pizza is very over-priced.",Negative

Revised review: ordered Pizza Salvatone which had few sprinkled strips of steaks unlike the picture shown in the menu.

Far away from the consistency of Pizza Roma,Negative

After calling them a million times, they came and added the missing ingredients. Also, the platter says 3 dates but they provided only 1. Not that it matters, but at least don't mention the quantity if you can't deliver. The vegetable and the Dory fish batter had hair. We were so pissed off and there was no time to change, so we just didn't bother to let them know or anything. The food was mediocre. Nothing exceptional. The service and the hair made the experience worse. Highly disappointed. We are paying for good service and good food. The least they can do is not serve unhygienic food and be nice to us.",Negative

They told us the prawn dim sum would be served in 5 minutes, but it came 20 minutes later. After an hour and half, around 2:30pm, we still hadn't been served anything else! We told the manager that we'll only take any food which they could serve by 2:30, but they failed to serve us our orders even by then. We paid for the dim sums and left ravenously hungry, with no apologies from the manager. Apparently there was some owner's brunch which caused this unacceptable delay! Worst service ever.",Negative
9394,"I love Chow's dumplings but the price I pay for includes food n service both. We went for a friend's birthday last month n ordered the lamb from the main course (as I had it before n I liked it). I put a piece in my mouth and found the lamb totally cold. My friend thought that the dish has to be served cold but as I mentioned that I had it before. So, I called the waiter n told him about it. He took away the dish right then and came back with explanation - ""the chef went out ...of the kitchen so the other person in charge prepared the dish and he forgot that he didn't warm it."" We are paying this price to have refrigerated food??? The manager came to say sorry n served us complementary brownie but how can it replace the fact that they serve cold food from the refrigerator. I have never seen the management write a reply to any of the reviewer so I wonder, does it really make any difference to them?",Negative
9396,horrible....price wasn't justified with the quantity of food..so was the taste �...and really dissappointed.,Negative
9397,Let's get one thing clear. A restaurant like Chows has two things to offer. Cuisine and service. Food is great. Proportions are not. Service not good at all. They'll take orders only to return about it's unavailability or the excuse of how difficult it would be to serve hot n sour soup as they're backedup at the kitchen. One garcon even took my dinner plate along with cutleries thinking that i'm done eating. I thought he's giving me a fresh plate after i tried their delicious flash fried whole fish. But I was mistaken :) Great chef. Poor service.,Negative
9398,"I was impressed by the decor but was disappointed soon by the food. Food is overpriced and bland. The quantity of each item was very small compared to its high price.I had better dumplings in Dhaka. The chowmein was chewy, leathery and cold. I didn't find any Cantonese flavour in any dish. Even the iced tea was very bitter. The service was very slow and poor. I didn't expect such poor service and bad food from a high-end restaurant like Chows.",Negative
9399,"A complete disappointment, most of the food we ordered was left uneaten as it tasted stale and unappetizing , the prawns we ordered tasted mushy and had a funky flavor, as did their whole fried fish and fried rice, not at all what you'd expect from a premium establishment. Do not recommend and definitely won't be coming back.",Negative
9400,"Ambiance is perfect for any hangout. Interior is beautiful & serene. Food is also awesome.. The prawn har gow, chicken sui mai, chicken chilly with black bean sauce.. Though the beef item that we ordered could not stand up to our expectations. But overall it was a nice place to spend time with near & dear ones with delicious food added.",Positive
9401,"Was extremely disappointed with the service yesterday. We went there for brunch and waited for nearly 1.5 hours and yet the food was not served. Whenever we inquired about the order, they kept insisting that the food would be out in 10-15 minutes. Eventually we got up and left. The staff needs to be given a training on customer service (try getting a crash course from the staff at Izumi)!",Negative
9402,Salt is a major concern. All the dishes that we had it was salty. Decor and service we're excellent. We reserved the private room.,Negative
9403,Well the food was good as usual. But a bit disappointed on the buffet offering during iftar. I thought the menu would be eat as much as you can but i was surprised with the appetiser being served once as set menu and buffet dinner on the five mains. Come on chows your edm for the offer was misleading,Negative
9404,"I made a reservation for four at 2:30 pm yesterday. I was there on time, however, my friends had reached a few minutes prior to 3:00 pm. Before they could make themselves comfortable, a waiter insisted that we order at once, since apparently their kitchen closes at 3:00 pm. We did, and waited for 40 minutes (which they asked from us) for our food. Immediately after we finished, our waiter had gotten us the bill before we even asked, and said that they were to have a staff pa...rty- an implication that we leave. The food was good, but not out of the world. Therefore, from such a high-end restaurant, service at-least is well desired from a customer's end. Provided the place would be overcrowded (or even close to being crowded) on the occasion of Pohela Boishakh, I would have understood. I'm afraid that many other reviews well portray how they tend to serve their customers.",Negative
9405,By far The best Chinese in town. Food is excellent and so is the ambience & service. No wonder why the elites and diplomats living around patronise it so highly both at lunch and dinner. However prices of items in recent months have been jacked up. But then in a premium eatery one has to pay premium rates I guess.,Positive
9406,"We availed the buffet iftar,dinner. But the iftar was set menu and dinner had only 5 items including rice & chowmein moreover the taste was average. I don't know about their regular menu but the buffet was not good.",Negative
9407,"Serious lack of cordiality comparing to the other places I have visited within last few days.. If u want to have good Chinese food find an alternative restaurant.. Interior is beautiful and a dimsum probably named prawn chicken Sui mai tastes good, the ginger drink was good but such a small amount was given",Negative
9408,"nothing special.... so so... we went two times but food was not that tasty according to the price...and recent days food served cold in many restaurants, don't know why??",Negative
9409,"I agree with some of the comments based on my experience. Great Food. Poor Service. This is the best way to summarize my experience at Chows. They really, really, really need to focus on service.",Negative
9410,"26th of March in the evening I was invited @chows hosted by my brother Azizur Rahman (Tel no 01713038440,) We ordered food but they failed to serve on time. First we wish to have some soup before the main course but they failed to serve accordingly to our choice. Food quality was excellent, but we were not satisfied with waiter's service.",Positive
9411,"But price is way too high compare to quantity and taste 3 out of 5 dishes were sweet kind , expectations were really high , but bit disappointed",Negative

9413,The brie stuffed French toast was excellent with maple syrup and berry. But i fell in love with potato ricotta cake. It was soft creamy and full of flavour.,Positive

9466,"After all the reviews about their service being not up to mark, i was a bit skeptical. But i was really surprised to find their service top of the line. They were very humble and veryyy nice. every person who came to our table and served us food had a big smile and they really do make u feel good about ordering and eating there. The food was just next level. My friends finished most of the appetizers by the time i was there but the 1s i did get to try were mind blowing. also ...their sauces are out of this world (especially this black bean sauce). i do not remember the name of the items but we had a fish a beef a chicken and noodles. each of them were perfect in their own way although i thought the noodles cud improve a wee bit. the fish (fish with black beans think) was the best. we all thoroughly loved the meal but my friends kept saying the appetizers (which i misssed) were better than the main course. Overall it was a great experience. i simply loved it. oh and the place is gorgeous and very well maintained. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",Positive
9467,Very Nice Environment but waiter response very slow . Food is good but not best .,Negative
9468,"Had a dinner reservation for 3 and after reading several of the reviews on the page and suggestions from family and friends, decided to have a Dim Sum night. Placed 6 orders of various Dim Sums. The first one to arrive was the Steamed Spicy Glass Noodle Dumplings which were average, not my preference. I was quite taken away by the Steamed Mushroom and Herb Dumplings, sort of reminded me of the mushroom momos from Crepe o Momo. That's the end of vegetarian dishes and now my fa...vorite, the meat dim sums. The Chicken and Prawn Sui Mai were tasty, a little hot and would order again. The Beef Cheung Fung looked tastier than it really was. A friend described the taste as a savoury lychee. On the other hand the Crispy Prawn Cheung Fung was the highlight of the night and ended up ordering two of those. The last order was a Prawn and Water Chestnut Dumplings which I devoured with complete satisfaction. At the end of the night, I was full and content. To accompany the dim sum was still water, and service was normal, nothing extraordinary. Overall good dining experience, loved the decor and would visit again.",Negative
9469,Really a good Chinese restaurant..... Environment is nice...and food quality also fine. Various kinds of Chinese cuisine you can try. So don't be late. Just check them out now.,Positive
9470,"Their iftaar is too much expensive and the quantity is very much disappointing. Here in BD we can avail the Buffet ifter along with dinner in Tk 1800/1600 or even in 1200 , where the Chows iftaar ( one plate set ) is 1400 and ++ goes to Tk 1700+. I don't know why they have chosen the Ramadan for their plunderage and we are encouraging them by taking the part of that dishonesty !",Negative

9476,The dumplings were quite good but our main course was a big disappointment (we had chicken with cashewnut and Xo sauce and prawn with garlic and chilli).

9477,Very poor Service .... This restaurant dnt know how to deal with their customer ... People who have enough time and prefer to eat cold food thn this is the right restaurant for them..,Negative
9478,"Waited an hour and a half for cold food and the waiter was very rude. There were 3 kids with us and he claimed our order was ""poor"" for 9 people. We asked repeatedly for the manager who never came. No discounts or apologies.

9485,I was informed about CHOWS from one of my friend. Went there and found an excellent experience. Keep it up. Wish you a good luck!,Positive
9486,we went to Chow following much hype regarding the food and so forth. Unfortunately turns out as following (1) waiters are very poorly trained regarding assistance during placing order and also hearing out on table preference. (2) food is not of much good/better taste then of recently opened other similar restaurants (3) Waiter's advice on the portions were HORRIBLE Highly discourage visits to Chow not only for the service but also for the taste of food.,Negative
9487,"Going through your Facebook page, nowhere does it say that you have to make prior reservations. My husband and I went to Chows on Friday night, and we were literally turned out because we had no reservations! I see from one of your reviews that another customer had the same complaint. This level of customer service is unacceptable! As a regular food connoisseur, I'd suggest that you teach your staff customer relations because no amount of glitz and glamour will get you loyal customers if your restaurant has abominable customer service!!!",Negative

9489,Best dim sums ever! Great ambience and well behaved staff. Good job guys!,Positive
9490,"Really great Chinese food. The sweet and sour chicken made my day! Love the design of the interior, the natural light from the large glass windows, the music, the ambience. The waiters were very polite as well. Keep it up!",Positive
9491,I made a reservation at Chows and went their with my foreign guests. Went I called them to reserve a table they told me that the last order was at 3pm however they will consider my foreign guests and still serve us lunch after hours. When I went there with my guests they literally shut the door on our face and refused us to enter the restaurant. They should have never accepted our reservation if they were unable to serve. They don't have basic human decency. I even told them ...that my Chinese guests would just like to look around even if they cant serve us lunch. Still they shut the door on our faces. How can they be so rude to customers when they will have no business without us. I sincerely advice them to learn how to operate a restaurant and teach their staff basic manners. There are number of Chinese restaurants in Dhaka so don't think that your restaurant is any special.,Negative

You claim to give buy 1 get 1 free offer which means that the food should be enough for four but it wasn't enough for hardly three. Plus you couldn't even give the dishes mentioned in your chart. If you can't provide the exact thing then you should say that. I was so embarrassed in front of my friends.

9685,Went there for lunch today: Environment is so so. Sitting arrangement as well as sits are not comfortable at all. Don't know who are their target customers. Ordered set menu 2 for four. Food was ok type. But prawn pad thai was the worst. It was crap. The chef/cook has basic problem of cooking process of Pad Thai. He needs trainig. Initially pad thai (rice noodles) was boiled in less amount of water. So it's got sticky. And not stir-fried. In addition amount of fried rice was not good enough for 4 person. Overall rating is 2 out of 5.,Negative

9694,"The most terrible food i've had in a long time. They couldn't get a single dish right. The food was either too salty, or too tangy, or just tasted bad. Never going back.",Negative
9695,"The food was terrible. The saving grace was that it looked good, but thats all . The stir fried beef in sesame oil had buckets of salt, so much that we had to send it back. The general tso's chicken tasted like bits of chicken in tamarind paste. The service was good considering we were the only two customers in the entire place. And now we know why. Most of the food was inedible, however they didtry to fix the beef dish but the result was just weird tasting sugary over salted beef.",Negative
9696,Just came back from Rice and Noodle. We went after your great Ramadan reviews so naturally had high expectations. Both our Prawn Pad Thai bowls had guess what JUST ONE prawn in it The Chicken Chowmein was clearly made of Cocola noodles and sadly our maid can make a better noodle dish. There was another rice dish which was so bad that I even forgot the name. I will not want to rate your place(i.e. 1 star is even too much) because seriously the experience was VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING.,Positive

9702,"Tokyo Express is my go to place for Japanese Food - the Ambience is great, the staff is friendly & cooperative - Food has always been excellent - I love their Sushi, Maki roll, Crab salad, Bento boxes & Chillers - however a few more alternatives / options/ variations in the Bento box would be really nice - the only diwnside is the restroom - it needs to be redecorated & kept clean as it's dirty & not maintained",Positive
9704,"The people of Tokyo Express have turned to thievery these days. It was bad enough that the service has gone to hell and that the food portions have decreased in size, they have also turned to stealing your food. Went there today with the family and there was a lot of food left over so we asked them to pack it for us. Got home and saw that all the left over sushi was not there. They didn't pack it. Packed everything else but the sushi. Really disgusting to think that they either ate it or they were going to serve it to the next customer. Really appalling Tokyo Express.",Negative
9706,"I lived japan two years. That time i was falling in love for Sushi. Every weekend I ate lot of sushi. Last year i came back to bd, and thought in my entire life i will not eat sushi as good as sushi meijin in japan. But I was surprised to eat shamon sushi in Tokyo express, that was exactly same taste like sushi meijin in japan. But honestly speaking it is too expensive than japan, whereas japan was one of the most expensive country in the world, Thier food cost, labour cost is too high. But In bd why sushi price is too expensive compare to rice and beef sysling I don't understand. Whatever the sushi was too good. I am so happy to have it.",Positive

9710,We had a really bad experience today in tokyo express.. we go there at 4/ 4.30 .they said we have to order food now..coz there Break time will be started right now.. that's why we ordered as early as possible.they also surved it quickly.. after finishing our meal.At that time there kitchen was close nd break time was started for the staffs.. so cleard our bill.nd started taking some pictures.when we cleared our bills at that time they just turned off all the lights of the res...taurant... At that time we r taking pictures they told us nothing bt turned off lights ac even also closed the door..just got shocked by their behavior.what kind of bad Manner is this?? I never face this kind of behavior in my entire life..no courtasy atall..we pay a handsome amount to eat there.nd they can't behave like this.. i really feel insulted... I think we will also give negative review for ur staffs mannerless behavior,Negative
9712,"Worst ever experience of dining out at Tokyo Express in Gulshan! With high expectations I took my daughters to have dinner tonight there.I wish I never had gone there . I have tried almost all of the renowned restaurants in Dhaka but this was a nightmare.The service is horribly bad, food came late beyond one can expect Finally when it came, the main dish we crazed for never arrived. We just waited to see what was happening.It wasn't served till the last! Amazingly when the bi...ll came, we were charged also for the dish we never had. The person serving was most inexperienced, ill mannered & paid no attention to our needs. We don't eat free, we pay a lot of money for eating out. I will also complain to the CAB for such managements! The owners of Tokyo express should be more careful in providing services to their customers . I shall never ever go to this place and would highly recommend everyone to think not twice but many many times before going to this restaurant. I had terrible experience tonight ! Thanks to Tokyo express!!!!!",Negative
9714,"Loved the classic bento! Specially the crispy chicken with white sauce (forgot its name :P ) and the sushi which comes in the bento. Al Hamdulillah. I hate wasabi, I almost choked! The watermelon juice saved my life. :( I personally didn't like the teriyaki tofu, but my family members loved it. It would have been better if it was deep fried and then cook with teriyaki sauce. Just my preference. Anyways, overall experience was good apart form this. The service was amazing. Thank you Tokyo Express <3",Positive
9715,I ordered take away Firstly this afternoon before Juma I try to order 2 classic bento box They said come after 2pm Than we can serve you Only after Juma... I came all the way from Dhanmondi I placed my order again over the phone They confirmed that come in 10mts It will be ready But when I reached and settled my bill Now they ask me to wait for 10 to 15mts This means they are placing my order now I don't understand why they committed the time line And being so regular and loyal to Tokyo Express This service is unbearable Management put ears to the complaint Otherwise you will be history Service and Timing matters ....... You are not the only option in town !!!,Negative
9716,"Much like the environment but main thing is there's food which is not good but fair. Cz I tasted the sushi of various places but this restro sushi rice was very lame,Like it's almost mashed..& other food was too & too much oily which is not good for stomach of Ramadan season & also u feel not to eat that.

9719,"Well, they charge a 25 taka local soft drink can 40 taka. Apart from that, everything is satisfactory. The ambiance is excellent. The food is exquisite and very tasty. I took the Classic Bento and enjoyed it to the last bite. Had the 25 taka FANTA can been 25 taka instead of 40 taka, I would have given it a 5 start with my eyes shut.",Positive
9720,"Tokyo has been one of my very very few favorite places from the time they started but what i have tasted recently has left me utterly disappointed. Firstly the rice, tokyo's fried rice tasted amazing itself but the rice tastes like ""norom bhaat"" i even found few ""shada bhaat er dola"" did you change the rice or something because the rice tastes plain disgusting now! second, the spicy osaka beef tastes rubbery and seems like the only thing used to cook the beef was soy sauce and nothing else. The nanban doesnt even taste the same. the jumbo prawn tempura was the only saving grace! i really hope the management looks into this! this is extremely disheartening for a loyal customer of yours such as me.",Negative

9767,"Was expecting a great service; after getting recommendation from quite a few friends. Shortage of Miso soup (really? In a Japanese restaurant? REALLY?) The ramen (not really but let's call it the name it was given by the restaurant) came last even though we asked for it first. Also poor choice in music (over remixed pop; c'mon it's 2017), trying to compensate for it by turning it to a deafening amount of loudness. Poor service overall. It's cold in here. I won't recommend coming here but if you do, bring a jacket or a shawl. MOSQUITOS EVERYWHERE. I MEAN EVERYWHERE. IT TOOK ME 25MINS TO WRITE THIS BECAUSE IT'S SO LOUD I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK !!!!!",Negative

9794,Delicious food within good budget and nice environment.,Positive
9795,I often order the cold bento box through HungryNaki and I must admit that I love it. I really enjoy the assortment of sushi it offers.

9830,"Decided to pay Tokyo Express a visit - took us few minutes to find the place. If you are coming from Gulshan-Banani Brdige-end Just do a left on Road 9 then take the first right. Restaurant is on the ground floor and before you reach the main entrance you pass a few tables occupied by mostly university student types and smokers. As I went in, first thing I noticed is that the restaurant has very poor acoustics and was very loud - specially the inside rooms. I asked the Waite...r to explain the menu as he did, I was unable to understand half of what he said - problem with both his English and Bangla pronunciation. The decor was average, Steel cutleries already showing wear and narrow ends of chopsticks are worn out – the shiny coating has come off exposing the wood like material. Tokyo Express should provide disposable or better quality chopsticks as micro food particles can easily stick to the exposed material. We were just given one small empty sauce bowl for our soy sauce/wasabi mix to dunk our sushi - there were two of us and they should have given us two sauce bowl as I personally do not like to share my sauce bowl with others. We ordered the the assorted sushi dish, Chicken Nanban and Osaka spicy beef and fried rice. The Sushi tasted quite good 2 pieces each - of prawn, cuttlefish and salmon. The sushi rice could be of better quality. This would make the sushi extremely good. Chicken Nanban is an average dish but was quite delicious. Made with ice cube sized chicken breast pieces on a light sauce. Sauce tasted like Oyster sauce with soy sauce and sugar added in. A very plain dish. Osaka spicy beeft also tasted very nice - dry shredded beef cooked in hot and light teriyaki sauce and spring onion. The dish was quite tasty. Fried rice also tasted nice but seemed just a tad bit oily. Cooked in less oil the dish would taste just as good. The watermelon juice was average; it was naturally sweet but lacked body and volume. Bill was just above Taka 2000. For the price Tokyo express is a good value with decent food. Although I was not wowed by any of the dishes, I was not disappointed either. Definitely recommended for sushi (at least for the price) and casual lunch and dinner. The menu choice is very limited; I would advice the owners to add more items. >M.M",Positive
9831,"We took the Chicken Canban(?),Sushi,Osaka (?) Beef, Giant Prawn Tempura and Tokyo Fried Rice.Food was good,liked it.The chicken was best!",Positive
9832,My most favourite Cuisine from now on :) Thanks to the Chef ! LOVED it.,Positive

9834,"Pretty much everything on the menu is awesome. Best dish: Tokyo Fried Rice, Grilled Squid & Octopus, and the Salmon Sushi (very fresh!)... The ambience/atmosphere is very cozy. Only 1 suggestion: do add green tea to the menu (hot & cold options) and it'll go perfectly with everything else.",Positive
9835,Great food. Imbuing dishes with a seasonal feel and bringing out the natural flavors of the ingredients are very important parts of this style of Japanese cuisine......Tokyo Express successfully done it. The restaurant- wait staff are all very polite and treat diners with exceptionally thoughtful hospitality.Their deep admiration of the seasons and warm thoughtfulness towards the customer reflects a sense of aesthetics that prizes tranquility and simplicity.,Positive

And they said, wedges won't ve available so they served sauted mushrooms. Yuckiest mushrooms that I've ever tasted and the amount could be counted in 1 hand( 8-10 pieces of sauted mushroom) though in the offer picture, It showed a small bowl full of wedges. I'm never going to sbarro baily road or in any branch or sbarro again. Loss of money and disrespectful to my tastebud.",Negative
9873,"Had worst experience at khilgaon branch today. Pizza crust was damn hard, hardly any cheese. Ice lemon tea had no ice, when asked for ice told that ice is finished. Wedges were 8-9 pieces only and we had to wait for this shitty foods for more than an hour. Waiter forgot what we ordered and around half hour later came to us and asked what we want again! We were much excited, as Sbarro opened new in Khilgaon. But if this the service and food quality, no need for it here.",Negative
9875,"I don't know what happened 4 months ago with all these negative reviews. Sbarro had always been my most favorite pizzeria in Bangladesh. I'm almost a regular in this shop. I'm a big fan of their Gulshan outlet. Tobay I visited their Bailey Road outlet. Mr. Masud Rana served me all the way with kind and good professionalism. I ordered 1 NY cheese, 1 NY chicken tikka, 1 NY hot & spicy and 2 Iced lemon tea (My all time favourite). All of them tasted really good. Specially the NY...",Positive
9876,"Worst sehri-outing experience I had till date. Yesterday afternoon, I called up the baily road branch and reserved seats for nine people. The staff member who talked to me had confirmed and assured me that the reservation was placed. At 2:15 AM when we actually arrived at the restaurant, we got to know that this reservation was never communicated to the sehri shift staff member. Kudos to them for their great professionalism :) But this was only the start. They served us the first plate at 3:27 AM, a mere 11 minutes before the sehri deadline. We waited for more than an hour thinking that okay they didn't communicate the reservation among themselves but surely a franchise like Sbarro will be able to serve up some platters in 30- 40 minutes. We were dead wrong. Even after taking such a long time, they didn't serve the full platter. Barely half of the offerings were plated in front of us. Sadly, all these things weren't the most pathetic part of the experience. This sham of a restaurant they are running didn't even have spoons! Yes, a restaurant without spoons. We had rush-eat rice with a fork and a knife. With 11minutes till the sehri deadline.",Negative

9878,I went to Gulshan sbbaro thrice where the food was very good and high quality. But for last 4 times I went to Baily road outlet.Extremely unprofessional staff.Don’t even know how to perfectly bake a strombly.

But cafe rio, a big disappointment. They banned me and other customers who comments against their restaurant. They are like autocratic Aladin. They will be cutting everyone's pocket with cheap, rotten foods instead of taking criticisms . This is called 'কুত্তার লেজ কখনো সোজা হয়না'. They are shame in the sector of food in Bangladesh.

You can easily guess how much neat and clean the restaurant would be just by observing the washroom of that restaurant. In this case, I will give 4.5 out of 5. I had french fries and burger. I think the bun was a bit little compared to the chicken meat and come on, I wanted a burger, not salad. Though it tastes... Thumbs up for the chef will visit you soon.

Yuckiest mushrooms that I've ever tasted and the amount could be counted in 1 hand( 8-10 pieces of sauted mushroom) though in the offer picture, It showed a small bowl full of wedges. I'm never going to sbarro baily road or in any branch or sbarro again. Loss of money and disrespectful to my tastebud.",Negative

Wedges were 8-9 pieces only and we had to wait for this shitty foods for more than an hour. Waiter forgot what we ordered and around half hour later came to us and asked what we want again! We were much excited, as Sbarro opened new in Khilgaon. But if this the service and food quality, no need for it here.",Negative
10645,"Worst sehri-outing experience I had till date. Yesterday afternoon, I called up the baily road branch and reserved seats for nine people. The staff member who talked to me had confirmed and assured me that the reservation was placed. At 2:15 AM when we actually arrived at the restaurant, we got to know that this reservation was never communicated to the sehri shift staff member. Kudos to them for their great professionalism :) But this was only the start. They served us the first plate at 3:27 AM, a mere 11 minutes before the sehri deadline. We waited for more than an hour thinking that okay they didn't communicate the reservation among themselves but surely a franchise like Sbarro will be able to serve up some platters in 30- 40 minutes. We were dead wrong. Even after taking such a long time, they didn't serve the full platter. Barely half of the offerings were plated in front of us. Sadly, all these things weren't the most pathetic part of the experience. This sham of a restaurant they are running didn't even have spoons! Yes, a restaurant without spoons. We had rush-eat rice with a fork and a knife. With 11minutes till the sehri deadline.",Negative
10647,"I don't know what happened 4 months ago with all these negative reviews. Sbarro had always been my most favorite pizzeria in Bangladesh. I'm almost a regular in this shop. I'm a big fan of their Gulshan outlet. Tobay I visited their Bailey Road outlet. Mr. Masud Rana served me all the way with kind and good professionalism. I ordered 1 NY cheese, 1 NY chicken tikka, 1 NY hot & spicy and 2 Iced lemon tea (My all time favourite). All of them tasted really good. Specially the NY... hot & spicy (Definitly recommended). Sbarro always served the most fresh dough or crust. It felt soft and well baked. They use just the amount of cheese the pizza needs. They do well with the pizza sauce they use. Perfect tasting pepperoni. Well seasoned. Not everyone is going to love all of the pizza flavours. But I think you'll definitly find one you'd love. I have jsut a small issue with the Iced lemon tea. Except mohammadpur and maybe dhanmondi outlet, I've been to every other one. In the original Gulshan outlet they use huge beer mugs for the Iced lemon tea. But in some other outlets you'll find them using thin narrow glasses to serve the lemon tea which is sad. And the taste varries from outlet to outlet. The taste is like a hit or miss. They should try to fix that. And I liked the fact that only they had their one signature 18"" sized pizzas in BD. I hated it when they started introducing different sizes for their pizza. Well, it's just me complaining. Happy feasting.",Positive
10648,"It was our first visit to Sbarro, Mohammadpur branch... The first thing that impressed us was the hospitality of the staffs, specially Mr.Sunny... This all-time smiley faced person was very polite and friendly... We ordered Stuffed Crust Pizza with sausages and pepperoni and Iced Tea... Pizza was delicious and juicy and the Iced Tea was simply awesome... Thanks to Sbarro Bangladesh for giving us the original taste of Sbarro... :-)",Positive

10651,I went to Gulshan sbbaro thrice where the food was very good and high quality. But for last 4 times I went to Baily road outlet.Extremely unprofessional staff.Don’t even know how to perfectly bake a strombly. Every time it’s raw inside.For a chain shop like this where we are paying a lot and getting undone food this is just not done.Sbbaro was one of my favourite place but for these bad services I don’t think I will ever dine in there.You should do something with your service.,Negative
10653,"Pizza was disastrous. Too much oily that I had to use tissue paper to soak the oil before eating. So called ""Iced Teas"" came without ice, it wasn't even cold. When asked, they replied that they are out of ice, at least they could use cold water. Who drinks tea that is neither cold nor hot (dumb face smiley). Pizza Hut is way way way better",Negative

When I saw the opening post (after the BESTever QR Code campaign and BEST quality Facebook post design), I, along with 3 other friends went to the Asad Avenue Outlet. As it is the soft launching phase, so I am not judging them based on their service. This is all about FOOD QUALITY. The crust was as thick as pillow (বালিশ). The closest competitor in terms of crust thickness would be Captain's World (which I had ...when Ashraful was our Cricket Captain and always regretted before today). Apart from the crust, the pizza was TASTELESS. Maybe you might think I have too Bangali a taste bud, but I never wrote bad review about any place. Yes, I have never been to NY but I have been to Europe 2 times. I am this furious because I have spent BDT 2550 for 1 KG of plain flour crust. Sorry, I could not take it.",Negative

Then again we went there after the day of opening and showed them the coupon but the servers said that those items were not available. The...y also said if I want to use these coupons and want to have that meal I have to go to another outlet as the mohammadpur outlet didn't have those meals. I mean it is already opened! Why does it still don't have combos and other things available? Every outlet has launched together so every outlet should also have same pizzas and other items available! You guys should take care of that. Otherwise the pizza was good.",Positive

10841,A very friendly welcoming place to spend a couple of nights. All personnel were very well trained and helpful (all done with a smile). Everything was handled with efficiency and attention to every detail was given. Food was delicious and Thanks (SANNY) for doing such an outstanding job to make the stay so pleasurable.,Positive
10842,Ordered a slice of Chicken Tikka and a Cheese Pizza. However The served crust was way over toasted. It was unimaginably dry and hard. I am sorry to say i went to sbarro with high expectations fuelled by all the reviews i saw. I have to say I was quite disappointed,Negative
10843,"Tried out almost every slice of the pizza available on the menu today. The item Signature Stuffed Crust - Chicken and Broccoli was the best of all with its beautiful aroma and cooking style. i will give Sbarro the highest rating of all the pizza places I have ever been. And thanks to Staff member Miss Ranu Chowdhury for serving us with honor. Appreciate the good behavior and asking for our feedback. In a word, the food was good indeed. Totally worth it. And also I would like ...to add an extra suggestion in the end. The VAT is okay But I have never seen to take service charges from the customers or billing with VAT and SC or DC whatever. I would recommend that as the pizza prices are a bit high, so why not include or adjust the extra charges with the item prices. I hope this review would be taken into account seriously. Thank you.

10858,"So I went there for the unlimited offer during Ramadan. Pizzas were really good. Hot, cheesy, crisp and tasty. All of the flavors were served. Service was satisfactory. Sunny bhai did a really good job. Drinks were watered down but it works for me coz I don't like the fizz. On the negative side, too crowdy and they added many extra tables and chairs. It was like a fish market ! The heat of the ovens neutralized the cold air of ac, so it was hot inside the restaurant. Food was good but atmosphere was horrible.",Positive
10859,"Drinks were literally not up to the mark. It felt like Water. Out of 7 flavors, 3 flavors should not be beef. For some people there was very little variations of Pizza. And had to wait for each slice initially which really killed the appetite.",Negative

10900,Well your service was crap. Like no one came to serve us once in a while unless we called. And even then no one would respond most of the time. Pizzas were mediocre. Slices should have been smaller. The mushroom and classics were underwhelming. And the drinks... Arhhh. Ever hear of variety? Coca cola ain't the only soft drink.,Negative

10906,This is my first review. Went to Sbarro Bangladesh last week! If you are a pizza lover then you should definitely go there. So they serve 7 kinds of pizza . And I'm rating them according to how it tasted to me ... So here it goes. 1. Super supreme : 8/10 2. NY chicken Tikka: 9.5/10 3. NY cheese : 9/10 4. NY spicy beef: 8.5/10 5. Chicken Italian sausage :8/10 6. NY mushroom pizza : 7.5/10 7. Chocolate dessert pizza :8/10 Environment: 10/10 Everyone was absolutely well behaved. The atmosphere was energetic mostly cuz the game was going on. NB: the ratings above are based on my personal experience. It may vary from taste to taste.,Positive
10907,"Excellent service,food and environment! One of the best stuffs! Loved all the pizza's especially the chocolate one! Hope to visit again when you guys open in uttara! �",Positive

10914,"We were 6 people yesterday and it was all our first time trying unlimited pizza and we're glad it was at Sbarro. The pizzas were quite good, but the service provided to us by Mr. Sajib was even better, which over all made it a good experience for us.",Positive
10915,"I guess they serve the best pizza in Dhaka and the fillings on the pizza were too delicious. More over, their service was too good. We got Shojib & Kakoli who served us really well & with their generous hospitality behaviour made us feel like home. We took unlimited pizza offer. As usual NY cheese, NY mushroom & chicken tikka hold their top position in my favorite list. Keep it up Sbarro. Good news: Sbarro is launching 8 more branches around Dhaka city soon. So, it's a request to Sbarro team, please always try to maintain the same quality as they are now. Cause many renowned pizza restaurants have degraded their quality gradually for profit.",Positive
10916,well i decided to give you 4 star but for MR.SHAJIB'S service I put 1 extra star here. and pizza was amazing as always.,Positive
10917,"[I did not have Sbarro's food so my review is based on their service only] Earlier today I messaged Sbarro asking if they took any reservations, and they replied saying that they did not in fact take any reservations and that it's on first come first serve basis. Which seemed fine to me. When I went there later on today, it was jam packed with people as expected but what surprised me was when the guard asked me if I had a reserved table or not. And then one of the waiters as...ked me the same thing as well. Lots of people were still going inside because they had reserved their seats and I just stood there surprised that they denied taking reservations earlier today and lo and behold they actually did take reservations. In the end me and my siblings had to dine elsewhere. This kind of confusing service is extremely disappointing, especially coming from Sbarro which is widely lauded to have amazing service. And this was our first time there too. My question is this, if you did take reservations then why deny that fact to a potential customer?",Negative
10918,The food was amazing. Overall the experience was really good. The service was top notch! Special thanks to Mr.Sajib who was at our service throughout the evening. One of the nicest guy i came across. Excellent food with excellent management!,Positive
10919,"very good pizza indeed. but what I liked most is their service. They are really polite. particularly the one who served us Mr. Sajib was very well mannered. as we came late they offered us to eat till 11 pm, which was a very nice gesture. hope to visit sbarro again. :D",Positive
10920,"Loved it. Definitely the best pizza place in town.The slices were bigger with thinner crust & the toppings n cheese were too much awesome. The guy who served us named sajib was a true gentlemen, loved his hospitality!",Positive

10926,"Me and my friends went to Sbarro today and ordered the ""Unlimited Pizza Offer"". They served 6 different pizzas and a chocolate pizza. The size and taste of the slices were great. Service was fast. Seating arrangement was alright. I would like to thank Mr Mehedi & Mr Tarek for their generosity and hospitality. Their quailty of service far exceeded my expectations. Some recommendations:... 1. Needs more parking spots. 2. 2 toilets aren't sufficient. 3. Please add more chicken/ vegetable pizzas, as many people don't eat beef. Lastly, your hospitality is your biggest asset. Keep up the good work!",Positive
10927,"Amazing service, amazing environment. Loved the way the manager and the waiters served us. Worth 5 stars. :D",Positive

10934,"Never visited the place before yesterday. Always tried their pizza whenever they visited our University. Too good food !!! Hospatility was to the point !!!

10959,"They make the strongest crusts in town. I mean you can literally hurt people with the slices of pizzas, they are so hard!!! The layer of cheese is so thin that it can easily beat Megan Fox's hip. On the positive side, The slices were colder than their AC for sure. Chilling experience in a hot weather!!! You can also eat the slices upside down. ... Don't worry, the toppings are glued, so they won't fall off. What a trick to impress your girlfriend!!! Ofcourse, if you have one. A slice of cold, hard, ruti with little less harder toppings. Even the garlic mushroom had too much garlic!!! Pepsi was literally the best thing on your menu!!! On a serious note, if you are charging 220+vat for a slice, i expect quality!!! You are branding pizzas and serving absolute disappointment.",Negative

You can have a look of what you are ordering for they have a sample for almost everything. The price is on higher side but it is eprth trying.

11000,Presentation is awesome BUT food is so so. Pizza not being instantly cooked so not very soft and cheesy. Too much bread. Too much of a good presentation covering up the quality of food,Negative
11001,i always stay away from beef and cheese... I allowed my friend to cut me a small cut off the pizza and I loved it. I had the pasta... The bread was amazing. Although its expensive... I don't mind having it once in a while.,Positive
11002,The pizzas are good but not really worth what they're charging.,Negative

11004,food quality is fine....all they need is to improve their service system....,Positive
11005,"Though everyone's been complaining about the waiters and service bt i found them quite friendly and cooperative...as for the taste it's a totally different kind of pizza...tried the beef sausage nd pepperoni and new york style crust(mushroom)..they were both amazing nd delicious...the pizza slices are huge nd much thicker having layers of cheese,sausages...so i wouldnt call them expensive...liked the ambience as well!",Positive
11006,I had the meat delight & the chicken tikka pizza they had available that day. Both the pizzas were quite average. The chicken pizza did not have any 'tikka' flavour at all plus I was dissapointed that they did not have a lot of variety of chicken pizzas. I did enjoy the lasagna though.,Negative
11007,"Pizza by the slice.. taste authuntic NY style, but didn't like the fast food style services...Price is little bit high..",Negative

11011,"Food is just awesome but the staff needs more training. Its really disappointing after the payment was made, the manager came and said the bill was mistakenly under calculated so we had to stay back and pay again. It wudnt be an issue if we frnds were there but I was here with guests and family. SHOULD TRAIN STAFF ON BEHAVIOUR AND MORE COMMUNICATING SKILLS WITH CUSTOMERS!! When I was asking for extra toppings the were all confused and replied that it was not possible. Later the manager settled the matter.",Positive

11015,"tried 3 different types of pizza and bread stick. the double crust was good and a new theme of pizza in bangladesh. stuffs r so confused and unskilled in a sense. when i gave my card to pay, it took at least 5-7 minutes and 3 person! একটা international chain shop er manager card এ টাকা নিতে পারেনা? মেয়েগুলারে আজাইরা কেন টাকা দিয়া রাখসে।।।",Positive
11016,Excellent NYC style Pizza served slice wise ! Price I would say a bit on the high end but still reasonable to my expectation. Tastes great. But the service needs a huge improvement. They stuff are well spoken and kind but seemed confused communicating with the customers.,Positive
11017,"Little bit expensive and if we compare with USA, its really too expensive. Pizza is good but not that much that Sbarro is charging. Service is not upto the mark. Too slow and confused staff. Most interesting part, SBarro dont accept AMEX :-o",Negative
11018,"So no complaints about the food which was excellent or the price which I found reasonable. But the staff have massive problems communicating with the customer or operating the sales counters. So this afternoon I head in, the place is nearly empty and I ask for a stromboli that isnt vegetables based. Four different staff offer me three kinds of vegetable based stromboli for ten minutes before one of them realizes I want a meat based stromboli and apologizes that they don't ha...ve any, wasting 10 minutes of my life. Then I head to the counter to pay, at which point the girl behind the counter presses buttons on the computer for several minutes before realising that the counter doesn't work. She apologizes. I ask her if I should go to my seat and wait for them to bill me or whether I should leave the note with her and wait for them to give me the change. She apologizes, I repeat my question. Other waiters join her in apologizing. A small crowd of apologetic waiters gather around me as I ask my question seven times and get seven rounds of apologies from more and more waiters. Then someone figures out that they can open the counter with the key that's next to the counter. At which point they take my Tk 500 note and give me my 30 Tk in change in three torn 10Tk notes, all three of which were scotch taped down the centre. At this point I should have known better than to ask, but I went ahead and asked for a pizza sauce to go with the pizza. I recieved three boxes of chilli powder/paprika from four different waiters before someone figured out what sauce was. 2/10 for service.",Negative

11026,Worst Management. Fired a waiter without where the management is clearly responsible for the fault. Provide food after a long time ( about two and half hours) of the placement of the order.

The menu is a bit large for my standards but some people like choices. The staff and server were friendly from the start. The waiting time for our food was a bit longer than usual; maybe because they were making the food from scratch. The Garlic Mushroom was a bit dry; not as juicy as it should be. The Seafood Salad was fresh,... Oh yeah, one more thing, I felt like the plating was below par.

On the other hand the BBQ ckicken was perfect, according to me it was perfectly cooked, in each an every bite the juicy flavoured of the chicken could be felt ,the BBQ sauce was a perfect combination with it.So over all it was not up to the mark of the pricing stratagy,the pricing should be around 230-250 TK. I know that a cafe have some overhead costs but still charging 300 TK on it, makes the food expensive comparing to the taste and quantity.",Negative

11295,"Wish could give a higher rating !!! We had an office party there on 22 Dec 17 of 30 guests. We needed separate seating arrangements for gents and ladies with different aged kids. They just did what I wanted. Even they kept one separate room for mothers who need to feed their babies. As it was Christmas season, so the hall was superbly decorated. The seating arrangement was not that quite but sufficiently spacious. About food, they were exceptional in case of choosing items i...n comparison to other hotels who offer the buffet of the same price range. They did not have 2/3 types Biriyani/ Rice items or any other similar food. There was no duplication of any menu. Starter items like soup and other snacks were not typical and were delicious. Ther main attractions were Small Lobster and Beef Steak. In addition to that, they had seafood and fish items too. They had variety in dessert items which we could not try as we were almost full then. We never saw an empty dish there. Whenever it was finished they refilled it without any further delay.They maintained high standard food quality throughout. If I don't say about two persons in this review then it will be an injustice to them which I must not do. Our party was a successful one only because of Restaurant Manager Mr. Zilhaj Parvez. He made everything in a way that we all felt like home. He was always there to fulfill our every requirement. Along with him, mess waiters were also very polite and professional with a smiling face. Another person is Md. Tazul Islam, Senior Security Officer, and an Ex Military person who ensured our tension free foodie time. As there was a shortage of underground parking, we had to park our cars outside. But this man ensured us about the security and was there with his troops till last maintaining extreme professional attitude. At last, all of us came out from there with a smiley face and satisfied heart. We all will look forward to going there time and again. Hope they keep their standard up always.",Positive

Worst suchi i ever tried, also with a foul smell!! But the worst was when we tried their firni it was totally sour with a foul smell. We showed it to the waiter n latter the chef confirmed that it has gone bad. They offered us another but by that time we were done! The manager was present but he didn't say anything! On the other hand the waiters and the assistant manager was nicer n more polite. Other Food items were okay, nothing extraordinary. But this type of management is not something you expect from a restaurant like this!",Negative

First of all they wanted to amuse their customers by providing free food. But in that case it must be tasty or according to their description. Unfortunately it had a blunder taste. The fried chicken size was 1/3 of the given picture ones. The sizzling had hardly any chicken but full of carrots. Imagine caram... They took order of 5 cold drinks but served 4, when we asked the reason they said they ran out of cold drinks. Even they didn’t have mineral water as well. Later on request they brought us a 500 ml bottle from downstairs. Now tell me in what kind of restaurants they ran out of drinking water??? It was a mistake of going after in such offers. Just thought they earlier provided good food so can give it a try. But sorry never again. ���",Negative

11970,"The service was so bad I can't imagine, how come they keep an offer while their microwave oven ain't working. lol it's offensive to hear but we all pay to eat right?? We'll always want the best. How come a restaurant like Cafe theatre have a single oven? If they don't have a single oven they could prepare our pizzas on the others right?? But as they had one and it wasn't working so they couldn't provide us with Pizzas!! lol I'm laughing my ass off and I'm angry like an active volcano in the same time as I've paid for the foods we had and we couldn't have what we wanted. The place is nice but their service us very poor. I think it was our bad omen that we went their to celebrate our birthday program.

11971,"So for my sister's birthday, we ordered takeout of the BBQ platter for four and got enough food to feed at least 6 people. To be honest, the food was mostly excellent. The Mexican rice was splendid. The chicken wings and the chicken sizzling were finger licking good. We found the green sauce too spicy, especially for those who can't consume spicy food. The disappointment was the BBQ chicken which weren't barbequed at all! There was no searing on the outside, the char a barbequed chicken is supposed to have was nonexistent. There was zero spice in it. Also, we found hair in several dishes which is totally unacceptable. I hope in future you'll improve your dishes more.

By that time they have already rounded up all the chairs and tables, which itself is not right if the official closing time is 11 pm. We ordered 4 cappuccino and were... waiting for our Sister to arrive.When she arrived at 11:00 pm they had already closed the sliding door. One of the staffs stopped her outside when she said my coffee has been ordered and they are waiting inside, which can be seen through the glass. The staffs kept arguing with her and given that the sliding door has already been turned off she got hurt hitting the glass door. This is sad as you feel unwelcome in a reputed coffee boutique. I personally feel this is what happens when you leave everything on the staffs. Quite a bad experience!",Negative

12726,"This review regarding the home delivery service in Dhanmondi. I placed my order around 8:45pm and got it delivered at 10:40pm. They took around 2 hours to deliver the food! I kept calling the hotline but nobody picked up the call for 23 minutes. The worst part is that this was the third time I faced an issue like this. They always give the excuse that their delivery man is facing problems. If Pizza Inn don't have adequate delivery personnel then stop providing the home delivery service! I am never ordering through Pizza Inn home delivery service ever again! Anyone who is reading this review if you are thinking of ordering pizza for home delivery in Dhanmondi, just don't do it! Majority of the time you'll end up with extreme disappointment and cold pizza...",Negative
12728,"Very bad service. Took a king khan offer and seated at the end of the row. As a result did not get pizza or drinks refill. Waiters served those who seated in the front row first and if pizza available than served me. I have repeatedly notified them that I am not getting any refill but nothing changed. Then just left the restaurant without having food with disgust. Just a disgusting experience. Hey Pizza Inn, if you cannot comply what you offer than do not do this mal-practice. End of the day service makes the difference.",Negative

12854,"So I have been a customer of Pizza Inn since it started in Dhaka with their own building in Gulshan,Dhaka. I really liked eating pizza here. But what yesterday happened what just really disappointing. Look people make mistakes. I know that. I saw mistakes in Pizzas since day one. But you people improved. Then you reached the top of pizza chain (atleast to me). But yesterday's service just dragged you down to the last. So like any other day, I went with my family to eat ...pizza around 7 p.m. I sat at my usual place in second floor. Then there was this offer going on where you buy 1 large pizza and get another one absolutely free. So i ordered this BBQ Chicken classic pizza with the another one Pizza Inn Special which costed more. So obviously they took the second one as my order and the first one as the free one. It took them about 20 mins which is usual. They first gave the pizza inn special pizza. No fork or knives were in the table. They never offered one too. Then after I asked, they gave them. The waiter also had lack of knowledge about service (It was not his fault btw because he wasn't trained well. And i even tipped him well because he was really young) Then there came my usual and most favourite flavour BBQ. But it was really disappointing when i tasted the second one (BBQ). It tasted exactly like the first was. It was extremely disappointing to eat two pizzas with the same flavour even i ordered two different ones. I asked the waiter about that but he said he didn't know. I hope you review you your mistakes because I myself never expected this kind of service. My family also got disappointed which made me feel sad because I was the one to force them to eat here whilst they wanted to eat elsewhere....",Negative

12893,"A story of disappointment and deception -_- Poorest food, price and service I have ever experienced! I am totally shocked at your response to the queries of the customers. It took about 40 minutes to deliver pizzas. Almost all the items are overpriced. The pasta I ordered was not worth 475 taka at all. Also, it was almost chilled, didn't look like you cooked it after I ordered. The waiter was always confused to our questions. You put the different columns for pizzas and crusts, well fine. But why there were no thin crusts which we ordered? Your worthless waiter was insisting us to order the high priced ones! That's how the pizza wich was shown taka 660 or something turned into 990 taka! Cunning policy, indeed. Totally disappointed at your work. Never coming again.",Negative
12894,"First of all they are not worthy enough to give even one star but since this is the minimum rating, I am giving one. Their delivery is very time consuming and on top of that they more or less forced us to take their stuffed crust which is of BDT 295. They have thin crush which they don't charge extra money for but that was not available. So it clearly proves that they are taking extra money for their so called stuffed crust forcefully! Now a days customers are willing to spend extra money on good food so you don't have to steal it from us showing lame excuses. If that is your business strategy then I suggest you to develop your business skills along with your pizza taste! They wrote BDT 600++ for their medium sized pizza but they took 990 instead because of stuffed crust which is so not worth the money!",Negative

Currently no one knows the actual status of its international franchisee license and clearly they don't care about the quality of food anymore. There used to be a time when this was country's only place for pizza and pasta. As many good competitors have risen up now, you don't have to eat the DRY, RUBBERY pasta, and TASTELESS, generic pizza they serve, not anymore. The well behaved waiters they have is a feeble attempt at justifying the ludicrous food they serve for the high price they charge.",Positive

12935,"today I ordered a home delivery 1 small cheese pizza and 1 medium beef pepperoni from pizza inn (dhanmondi). The pizza came exactly cold, the cheese small size is actually a baby size pizza, no cheese at all, literally no cheese. The beef pepperoni is so salty that u have to throw it out after one bite. The breads are hard like rock. The delivery does not have any sauce, chili flex or anything. In one word it was DISGUSTING..... If I could I would give 0 to them",Negative
12936,I love pizza inn coz they blended the taste of pizza with our food habit. Their HD never disappointed me with their delivery. We must consider the traffic that we face everyday and be considerate about any unintentional delay (when it really happens). Best of luck for pizza inn.,Positive
12937,"One of the most customer-friendly places comparative to other restaurants I have visited within Dhaka. I along with two more people went there (mirpur branch) to avail unlimited pizza offer at about 6:40 pm without even booking & obviously it was houseful. We were wandering here & there & then the manager approached to us on his own & suggested to have iftar in staff room. We agreed as there was no other option left. Dates, rooh-afza & cold drinks were quickly served & just before azaan, two slices of pizza were given to each of us. Eventually they were serving pizzas of different flavor (8 flavors) after every while & the manager was repeatedly saying sorry that we had to have iftar in staff room. Though they had to serve a lot of pizzas to a huge number of crowd but still taste was not degraded.",Positive
12938,"Worst ever service, thick bread with poor topings (they call this a pizza). We visited the Police Plaza outlet. It was our worst experience. We kept them calling with empty plates with huge appetite (we were fasting) and they didn't ever bother to come. The waiters were so mannerless! I won't recommend the place and not going there ever again.",Negative

Down side was the air conditioning systems were leaky and dripping water. They had shut off one of the doors to make room for more people which kind of made the place very stuffy with no room to walk. Otherwise, it was a good experience.

12958,I went to pizza in with two of my foreigner friends cause they wanted to try good pizza. But in pizza inn Dhanmondi they served us pizza with very thick crust and very thin layer of cheese. Chicken pieces were superficially given on top of that. I felt so insulted in front of my guests. They left the place with an impression that Bangladesh doesn't have any good pizza place. Really disappointed,Negative
12959,"With previous several times good experiences yesterday I went to police plaza concord brach at around 2:30 pm & wanted to place order their ""buy 1 medium pizza, get 1 free"" offer. But they denied to take order saying it will need more than 1 and a half hour (which will exceed the offer time), as they don't have dough of medium size. it is only the large size that I can order!! I never expected this kind of disgusting trick from such a reputed place!",Negative

When we asked for a discount for the horrible service, they said they would give a discount but the delivery man asked for the whole bill. Pizza was ok but will not be ordering again...at least not online. If you cannot keep up your own servers then you should make deals with third-parties like hungrynaki.",Negative

12969,"Indeed, Pizza Inn is one of the best places in Bangladesh for Pizzas. The Lasagña also tastes quite delicious. I ordered a medium-size pizza but the pizza seemed to be a large sized one. I went there with my friend and it was very difficult for both of us to eat it completely. The price is also reasonable as far as I do think. In fact, I would like to recommend that Pizza inn is one of the best places in Bangladesh where's food items hardly have any comparison in taste.",Positive
12970,According to price it should be something more!! And prices of the soft drinks are too much high!!,Negative
12971,"First of all if i start talking about the pizza, it was almost tasteless. I ordered one of their large pizzas, and due to a running offer i got one for free. If they cannot provide good quality pizza in an offer, why do they even give such offers! Again, totally disappointed with their slow service. The waiters are not even trained well. Whenever i wanted a tissue or a drinks, they started calling each other to serve me taking 5/10 mins just to come and talk. Never going back.",Negative
12972,"Poor service. Average quality of pizza, at best they can manage. Unbelievably slow. Ordered three items and it took them one and half hour to serve it. Don't even place tissue on the table: went there with 3 people. And they place just four tissues under forks and knives. and that's it. You want more tissue, they'll listen and will be gone. Ultimately, you have to fetch them yourselves. Paid for about 4k Tk, all of which feels completely wasted on nothing.",Negative

12976,"Worst pizza ever tasted. Ordered pizza with sausage crust. They gave it wrong. When complained, they replied saying they got technical issues (which was a very lame excuse). They used local cheese instead of Mozzarella. Made a chaos during providing the bill too. Overall I would have given a negative 5 if there was an option. All I can say is, train your waiters first before starting an outlet.",Negative

Please ask your Chefs to check the seasoning while they make the products or before serving, I do believe it will make your products more tastier. Service and environment were nice, though the server never came to follow up at all. It was my first visit, I would like to request you to train your servers on how to follow up with customers as well, it creates good impression about the brand, isn't it? Thanks",Negative

13012,Pizza inn shouldn't introduce such offer where they cant maintain the minimum standard. This has been my favourite pizza shop in town always even in such offer time. This time i heard so many bad comments from friends but with my previous experience I ignored to believe them and here i am today with utter disappointments.

When I told him that I have checked your website, he replied it can't be there. After that when I told him about t...he Deep Dish Pizza, he replied it is not included in the Offer. He also told me ""Deep Dish Pizza is very EXPENSIVE. It will cost around TK.1800."" Now my questions are: 1. If there is no such Pizza of Pizza Inn named Roasted Garlic Chicken Pizza Large, then why you are displaying in your website? 2. If I have checked your website, then I am certain about the prices of the Products. Do you tell your customers that ""Sir, this Pizza is expensive. Don't take this one? Later I ordered BBQ Chicken Classic Large & Meaty Max Pizza Large. This is not the first time I am getting this kind of customer service from your Uttara Branch.

The pizza was so oily and loaded with cheese and for that reason, i didn't like that. I couldn't find the exact taste of pizza because all i could find was the taste of cheese and cheese. So i didn't like the pizza at all. The french fries was good btw. But the drumsticks was so tasteless that i couldn't eat them all.... They were loaded with so much masalas that i couldn't find the actual taste of it also. I didn't like that one also. Lastly comes the apple juice. I couldn't understand whether it was apple juice or not. Because bad smell was coming from that juice. So i didn't have that one also. Not going to come here anymore. Waste of money!!!!! Another thing, the waiters which are serving don't know which food is available for the day. They have to ask their superior all the time. Isn't it annoying?",Negative

However, I had wonderful food experience at star lounge before but I don't think I am going there again. They have changed their chef which they admired on my query.

13458,Had chicken pasta and cashew nut salad. Pasta was very bland. Not enough seasonings and lack of any kind of taste. Amount of meat or mushroom was tiny. White sauce they surved was weird and .

13460,Best pizza. It was gravy and cheesy at the same time. And the burgers were soooo amazing. I loved it.,Positive
13462,First of all give up the habit of hawking people like Gulistan to your restaurant..Haven't seen this ever at any elite restaurant of this area.. . had pasta here which was 3/5.. it lacked chicken and cheese horribly..you can hardly find any of these in the middle and last parts..I should also personally say it lacked salt and spice(don't know about other people).. I think you guys need to stop the buy 1 get 1 shit and instead bring up your focus to the taste... for decoration I would rate 4/5.. it looks good overall thanks to the decorators.. Best of luck for future.. hope you guys can make quick improvement and cope up with the other famous restaurants in the food valley named Khilgaon �,Negative

13501,"1. The crust was really thin, almost like a Ruti. 2. Amount of cheese was not bad. 3. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant, there was hardly any chicken even masroom in the chicken supreme pizza. You can also count the olives. 4. The overall taste was good but for 279tk, considering the toppings, it was overpriced. The making of pizza in an oven in front of you is the main attention. You can give it a try but not really a place to go back just to have the pizza. Definitely overhyped and overrated. Best of luck.",Negative

After all i enjoyed different kinds of salad.my kid like s crabs & juce too much.totaly we setisfied their service.,Positive
13577,"Food was great, service was good too just lack of good management I guess cause to run the buffet restaurant u must need 3 people to take the empty plates from the table during people having their food. But I didn't see anyone there to take the empty plates. They did took the plates but after people left from the table. Its just lack of training.i worked and study in hotel management abord and I run many places abord so I have bit idea in hospitality sector so I hope the management will see my review and they will fix those small issue. Also they should serve proper roasted bean coffe to keep up the class. Overall I had a good time with my boys.",Positive
13579,"Last night I along with my 03 colleagues went there for buffet dinner. The items like beef or mutton curry were not up to the mark, meat lovers like us may be disappointed. 02 items of soup, fried chicken and noodles were good. Surprisingly, we found no item of prawn. We felt salads and dessert items poor and limited. I found small hair in different dishes which disturbed me a lot but I did not say anything as my mates could lose their appetite. Ambience and behaviour were good. Overall response is that Tk 800++ price for that standard buffet dinner is quite much and they must improve to ensure hygiene.",Negative

Fried rice and noodles and chicken chili was great. That tikka item was great. The biggest downfall is, there wasn't any beef or sizzling items!! I didn't liked the pasta...it was bad! And you guys should add more desserts please, Because the desserts​ sucked big time! I would never recommend shemai and firni in a buffet menu!! At least throw some cakes or chocolates. Maybe you guys mixed up the menu because of the Ramadan! I hope you will improve the menu in future! Thanks for your services ��� ���",Positive

But the food is not the fact.the fact is they directly argued with the customers.no policies.contains plenty of cheatings.their attitude and expression will mean you that they r teaching you and you r first time in restaurant.many worst policies they have which they wont mention you.most attentional sight was many worst policies you will see from them which you will never find anywhere.honestly I can say that if any one gathers here you won't came here for second time.and also reviews them 0.5 out of 5 ratings.im giving 2.0 ratings cz the food was average good that's why.but if I focus on behavior and policies I will rate it 0.5 out of 5.,Negative

But I didn't like the taste of their pizza and if you're not good at what you're offering then service and ambience won't do any good. There were sufficient amount of cheese but which tasted super crapy and I find the amount of onions were much more than the actual topping. I ordered the Family Size Double Trouble and Buffalo Wings. The wings tasted decent enough. So If before you visit this place give it a thought coz there are far better options.

I have tried their blue brunch offer ... after having delicious heavy breakfast we used their swimming pool for an hour , relaxed for few minutes ... then we had our lunch ... every items were perfectly cooked .. staffs were taking care of the food section every time .. that gives a good impression of a classy restaurant .. and the desserts are re...ally good ... I highly recommend to have their sushi , fish and beef steak ... I am going to try their new offers soon .. can't wait to share the wonderful eating experience with family and friends .. P.s. Plz try not to waste food ... take small portion . They offer a lot and refill food time to time . I personally feel so bad when good food in fact any kind of foods are being wasted !",Positive
13990,Good food good environment what you need more when you visit any place � but their hall room temperature wasn't good enough :/,Positive
13991,"Eatery is simply excellent, transformation on the items for the branch till noon is identical and candy for eyes indeed!! Great view from the skyscraper and swiming pool was just a compliments to an option to explore to observe the aesthetic part of the city!!",Positive
13992,"Environment is cozy, though selection of food in restaurant is quiet limited. Staffs seems to be quiet new....lack of promptness is seen..hope it will be overcome soon.....pool is a very tiny one...Underground parking is steeper than any mountainous slope..........",Positive
13993,Brunch was wonderful. Staff are ver helpful and smily face always,Positive
13994,Had very wonderful experience with my family at brunch...,Positive
13995,Cozy place bt food is good.�.environment is good.,Positive
13996,We were 6 people went to Four points to have brunch yesterday. It was a good experience specially with the 1 hour complementary access to the pool. We had lots of fun there. The view was amazing. Ambience was good and most foods were tasty except the Hilsha fish. Staffs were good and overall experience was good. However they could add ice cream on the buffet and few more exclusive items.,Positive
13997,"Warm welcoming along with excellent environment, services & security are really superb.",Positive
13998,First class service always a smile on their waiters face specially waiter Ankan and syed,Positive
13999,"The Eatery has one of the best buffet dinners in Dhaka. Small but decorated and with a great view from the 24th floor. The grilled river prawns, beef fillet mignion, penne arabiata, teriyaki beef, prawn dopiaza, in house ice cream, chocolate mousse are a must try.",Positive
14000,Loved the food and service! Had the weekend brunch offer this Friday and it was absolutely scrumptious!,Positive
14001,their brunch buffet is the best buffet in town without anydoubt..and their service is outstanding ..behaviour with customers is extremely good...the food items are heaven ...extremely tasty,Positive
14002,"A person who knows me can tell that I just live for good food and I love eating at different places where it is a 5 star or anything else. The Friday brunch of Four Points by Sheraton is awesome to treat yourself after a hectic week. It is a place which is very soothing and their staffs will make sure that you'll feel cozy there. I have been to Le Méridien, Westin and Raddison too but if you ask me which place serves you the best food then I'll say it is Four Points by Sherat...on. Now let's talk about the food, the best thing they will serve you is live juice station from the entire brunch session. The live kitchen has a variety of items to offer and to me the prawn tempura and the omelette with cheese were the best. They also serve you live pasta station. I had the best white sauce pasta with cheese, spices and chicken today. It was so yummy that I had the desire to start licking the plate. The main dishes were yummy too. The main thing is they will set a line of main dishes that you will want to eat like no dishes you'll not want to eat. I had a very good experience today there and I highly recommend this place.",Positive
14003,Their complimentary beverages services need to be improved.,Negative
14004,Not up to the mark........ Totally frustrating :/ :/ expected a lot better,Negative
14005,"Its classy, elegant and the service is very nice",Positive
14006,"Just 2 problems , in my opinion: ** Coffee = Needs to be NOT THIS MUCH LIQUIDY , NO MATTER WHAT THE BLEND IS. ** Price and proportion = especially coffee proportion... could be the opposite of the conventional. Lower the price and Higher the quantity and quality the better . Otherwise , the staff people , the ambiance all of it is Amazing .... !!! ... Thank you .",Positive
14007,I overall don't like this hotel.... Only photography is real.... Nothing else ...,Negative
14008,"অত্যন্ত চমৎকার পরিবেশ। বিশেষ করে ২৬ তলার টেরেসটিতে বসে ঢাকার যে দৃশ্য দেখা যায়, তা অনন্য।",Positive
14009,"My first interaction with four points was in the month of Ramadan during one of the Sehri. Since I was there with my friends, therefore I decided that I must get my family someday over here. Eventually I did, and I took the right decision. Perfect ambience, quality food and sober supportive staffs... Keep up your good works folks !!!",Positive

14016,"Good experience �. Good food with nice view, simple awesome",Positive
14017,The place was really nice...the quality of the served dishes were also up to the mark.definitely will visit again.,Positive
14018,"Well we had 1 ifter and 2 sehri in Four points, it is one of the indication of their improved menu and services! As their tower section is the new addition in the Ramadan menu, I must said they are providing great foods. Ramadan teaches us not to waste, so i tried to eat as much as possible but not keep any weste foods in the plate! I like the most is they did not put tons of variety rather quality foods and all that you can eat. All the stuffs are very friendly, they keep asking the guests if they need anything more. They tried to provide the best possible service. Apart from that. The view from the 24th floor is awesome! The manager Mr. Tareq and assistant manager Mr. Shaifur Rahman provide quality service and they are always on the move, asking guests if they were happy or not! Overall, we are satisfied customers! :)",Positive
14019,Nice hospitality. Go ahead . Wish all the best all member and Mar.,Positive
14020,The Sehri buffet spread were completely worth of the price for a SPG property. It was good in taste. Some items were just outstanding like The 'Paya'or ' or 'nehari' Salad and fruits bar was good and main dishes were mouthwatering. Second visit is awaiting sometime soon.,Positive
14021,"They are charging almost 4,000 (3,999) BDT for the buffet but do not bother to make arrangement to keep the food warm. Cold food ruined the taste of the items. My brother went there with his guest yesterday & became embarrassed of the food situation. if you don't want to keep your kebabs hot, then don't charge that much cz other buffets are charging less but giving better service than you. Pissed Off",Negative
14022,I like the service and the making selection of food. I was quite please overall and looking to go back again.,Positive
14023,Good menu but mediocre taste. Nothing exciting to the palate. The fruit table was good as was the nehari. Other items were ... Just there.,Negative
14024,Below average standard .. Communication with clients is bad nd behaviour should be developed ..,Negative
14025,It was awesome. I wanna go their again. wish all the best,Negative
14026,"Clearly a waste of time and money . The dishes were way below average . Nothing resembled the advertisement. Pure Deshi cuisine plus a few salads and desserts is not worth 2200 taka. Last but not least , the restroom was dirty and stall was too small for a hotel. ... Pizza Hut has a bigger washroom than yours . Definitely not coming back here anymore . Shall never recommend anyone to come here either .",Negative
14027,Its a beautiful restaurant good food and good view,Negative
14028,"quantity was there .. but lacked quality somewhat. nothing spectacular or exceptional to make it a stand apart experience. it was nice of them to include the juice bar with the buffet & service was upto the mark too. quality of beef being served can be improved, i found it bit hard to chew. desserts section was unimaginative .. lots of different types of cupcakes .. again nothing exceptional was noted.. lacked chocolate based items or any mousse & yogurts were missing too. BIGGEST DRAWBACK WAS SERVICE STOPPING AT 3:30 pm. In context of Bangladesh, it should have been minimum 4:00 pm. & a closeby smoking section would be nice. having 2 change lifts to get to their rooftop smoking area wasn't fun.",Negative
14029,"Tried buffet , average , a bit frustrating as majority items are not tasty. Good part availability of juices in buffet . Our expectation is higher , hope to see you like that , Good Luck:)",Negative
14030,This was worse experience of being there at eatery restaurant. In the street food market fest there were no Chinese dim sum station. There was sushi but very limited. Bottom line is they show something and in reality they serve something else. This is one way of cheating people. Food quality is very low.,Negative
14031,"foods were fantastic and MS. Cecilia Gomes (asst. manager-sales) was so cordial and showed us venue, room and swimming pool. It was a great time in Four Points by Sheraton Dhaka. I'll definitely come with my family as well as love to recommend my friends, family and colleagues to enjoy excellent service of this hotel.",Positive

14033,Review#1 Great new food joint in Dhaka City. Refreshing and mouthwatering. My new favorite place for buffet. Review#2 Simply Great. the best sea food place in town.,Positive
14034,"Very nice family place with good ambiance. Good food and better service. Will come again surely. Beverages should be included with the buffet. When you've advertised that the price mentioned is of all inclusive, then charging of VAT & others shouldn't be in place.... That doesn't bring good news to YOU. Anyway, overall I liked it and visit again to see new developments. Cheers!",Positive
14035,"Staff were really friendly, everything works, loved it",Positive
14036,"Most of the items were below average. Though there are many dishes, most of them don't deserve more than a bite. The advertisement is not all revealing, though it mentions Buy 1 Get 1 on Stan Chart Cards, there are particular specifications of the cards with offer, not all Standard Chartered Cards are liable to get the offer. And most importantly, though the advertisement mentions the Buffet price to be 3542 ( all inclusive), what has not been mentioned is that this excludes all beverages including water which will be charged at an exhorbitant rate plus 26.5% extra VAT and service charge on that. So those who are planning to go to the Street Food Festival, think twice.",Negative
14037,The food was horrible compared to la meridian while taking price in account. The restaurant eatery was small and had a handful to offer. I called them up to enquire about the maki rolls before going and found premade small rolls that was tasteless and looked cheep. Their continental side had few things to offer aswell. All in all dnt waste your money and time.,Negative
14038,Foods variety r very impressive. All items r premium.. They need to improve their Dessert section as they have limited selection.... Only bad side is they didnt offer me any drinking water...,Positive
14039,the Buffet on the 24th floor is pretty good. the selection is adequate. not too much or less choice. the esthetics and deco are well planned and organized. nice lighting and climate controlled. environment is joyful. I was there for press meeting of Harriken brand ambassador.,Positive
14040,Good food & ambience.Well mannered staffs.Great experience..keep it up.,Positive
14041,the one star is for the ambience and the lamb chops in the buffet. all the other items were pretty bad and they sucked. really SUCKED! To be honest its not worth tk.3500 that they are charging per person. who the hell gives papaya and tomato inside a crepe? its really sad when hotels like this provide food like baton rouge! money wasted. please hire some good chefs,Negative

14050,Ambiance & decor is good. The staff service was good. Food was average. Coffee was like being in a canoe - so close to water !!! However what peeved me was the staff trying to speak in English with an accent. The management and staff should know that there is no shame in speaking in Bangla to the Deshi customers. Will I be back? Probably - if someone treats me...,Negative
14051,"Located at the heart of the modern part of Dhaka, just at Gulshan-2 circle. the 28-floored Doreen Tower has been modified as this hotel. Though some of its floors are being used as office spaces but completely isolated from the hotel. They have started new, some of their staffs I met have been recruited from other hotels like Westine, Amari etc. and they know well how provide service to customers. Their restaurant and food menus I experienced found very selective and well cooked. Restaurant is in 24th floor with good view of outside. Specially their restaurant lounge at 27th floor will give you a splendid beautiful overview of the city which must be liked by all to have some time there to drink, smoke or to dine with nearest ones, so don't miss it!",Positive

But we were 7/8 sitting in the table. when we asked for more glass they gave us dirty glasses and that also after waiting for 5 minutes. And when we asked for the manager they didn't even pay any attention. Even though we were sitting just before the cash counter.

Kottu Roti - very good Yellow Rice - averate Chicken red curry - not near to srilankan style cyrry which i had at srilanka. It was more like Bangla style. Beef Nugamba or something (cant remember the name) - same as chicken curry. Although a bit different but doesn't have any srilankan touch. Moju - very good. The food was really good when I went there on the 1st month of their opening.,Negative

I wish Taste of Lanka the very Best Wishes.",Positive
14856,"A real, ""authentic"" taste of Lanka. Though a bit expensive, but no compromise with taste and quality. Grilled Prawn, Devilled Chicken and Coconut Ice Cream was best!

14912,"3 of us attended for lunch. The decor was minimalist but clean. The waiters were pleasant but need proper training. As this is a new cuisine for most of us, we had to ask for recommendations. This was not voluntarily offered. Even after we advised them of our lack of knowledge about Sri Lankan food. The waiter appeared to suggest the most expensive dishes as opposed dishes that we'd like considering we were describing what we were in the mood for. Ordering the food was a chal...lenge. We ordered a set menu they had available as this would provide the most selection. We also ordered parathas, egg hoppers and a beef curry. The waiters did not make suggestions that we'd need to order this additional food but it was essential for a full meal. It took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Once it did, I admit it was tasty but most of it was very spicy. We were not aware of this. We can handle spice but we still would've appreciated the waiters making us aware of it. The staff mentioned 3/4 of our way through the meal that we had two drinks which came with the set menu that we'd ordered. Whether this was done to make us order more drinks or whether the waiters forgot....both are unattractive. The set menu was priced in a manner I would say appropriate but the curry was overpriced. It cost just under 4000tk for 3 of us and in all consideration, this was a tad over what we would've felt was appropriate. I hope the suggestions are considered thoughtfully. I enjoyed the food so we shall be back, inshallah.",Negative
14913,"The food was fantastic ,too spicy,too yummy � I'll visit you again ��",Positive
14914,"The food was okay... but the service was terrible... th waiter told us tht it's going to take 20 minutes, but they served th food after 50 minutes!!!! The funniest thing is that they served the starter (chicken wings) after They served the main course... ���� Another thing is that they must rethink bout the portion of the rice they serve for 2 ppl in th platter!!!",Negative
14915,Tried the set meal for two. The taste was great but the service was a little bit slow.,Positive
14916,"Went to taste of lanka today.had lunch there with family.I really like their food.interior decoration,hospitality,clenness,taste of food is appreciable ! Wish them all the best!",Positive
14917,"The service was very good and the food was good too. The egg hopper, the egg rotti were just perfect along with deviled squids and the negombo beef curry. The pol sambol wasn't upto the mark though. They should add some more variety coz Sri Lanka offers a variety of dishes. Suggest to add Sri Lankan Tamil variety too especially the Jaffna style preparation which is more rich in flavor. Lovely staff and good ambience too",Positive

14937,Way too overpriced with a very typical food type. The portion size is ridiculous. With some other foods we took an egg hopper which costs 197+10% SC +15%VAT plus and its exactly ডিম চিতই which we can get at 15 taka. We had to made ourselves satisfies by dining in at Time out just near Taste of Lanka to satisfy our tummy. The owner claimed they have to import everything from Srilanka (why a guy need to have eggs and beef from Srilanka I did not get it though) which sounded like comedy of Russel Peter to me........and I literally laughed out.....,Negative

I have been with BFC's food since 2004.for me BFC chicken is the best in the town.I have visited almost all the branches in Dhaka and know many outlet managers those who are working for the last 20 years.But it is really sad to say, BFC, Mirpur 10 branch has got some problems. I have been there several times since I have shifted my residence in Mirpur. The staffs are not well mannered. I have shared some of them, incident 1: one... day they have served me wrong drinks, when i objected the waiter said, it is not possible. incident 2: sometime a portion of the total area is blocked, i requested manager, he ignored. last incident: When a half of the sweet corn are eaten i have found some parts of a steel dish washing net inside, I complained they wanted to give another but i said no.The young outlet Manager was in front of me turned around even saying sorry.I was horrified about thinking their cleaning stuff.Hope authority will frequent visit their outlets and will check hygienic food ,cooking stuff and customers feedback's.DROPBOX is the better idea.and managers should be well trained., so that other staffs can perform better.",Negative

But we were really hungry so we jumped in. we got only one chicken piece so we asked the waiter to cut into two pieces. and then everything went wrong. the waiter went with the chicken and then it never came back. after 15 mins when we aksed for the chicken the waiter looked surprise and said checking sir. and then he came back after five minutes. but to our surprise the chicken went to another table. and then when we asked again the waiter took those chicken for the that customers table and brought to us. at this moment i lost my temper and i asked,Negative

15246,"My first review consisted of 5 stars but today, I am bound to revise my review & mark it with 1 star. I am incredibly annoyed with the quantity & the quality of the food items which they provided from their Dhanmondi branch. I ordered online through pathao food. I ordered their platter, R2, & it seemed to me that I paid 2500+ taka for a mere box of French fries!!! I had the same platter twice, before, but they have seemingly deteriorated the quality & lowered the quantity of ...their food items. Probably, they re-use the oil in which they fry their items. There was a distinct smell of used oil. The fish fingers were unbelievably thin & small. I just could see French fries throughout the box & the calamaries & shrimps were very few in numbers. In Ramadan too, I experienced the same thing. I had enough of Manhattan Fish Market. Never ever going back there or ordering food online from them. They literally have lost a regular customer.",Negative
15248,I m really feeling sad to say that me and my friend went ur Dhanmondi branch today ... We ordered the Fish and chips (the best deal in the town) menu.... But they gave small pieces of 2 fishs... It's really so disappointing...but the good thing is that the test was good what I expected � please keep in mind that we pay money not for the food but also the good service,Positive
15250,Best seafood place in town. Awesome food and service. Special thanks to Shahriar and Shakil bhai (at dhanmondi branch). Wherever I visit the place they make me feel so special! Thanks so much! You guys rock! Will be visiting again and again! �,Positive
15252,I went to MFM on Saturday around 4:00 pm along with my Family. I ordered 4 dori special and Onion Rings and Mussels. Onion Ring was really bad and dori salad was stale and smell bad. Mussels were ok. We ordered four drinks but even after our meal is completed we did not get the drinks. My kids ordered two Gummy Bear flavour and they did get that either. Kids were extremely disappointed �,Negative

15256,"Yesterday's azan was at 6.46 PM. The restaurant had served tang and iced tea beforehand. After the azan, everyone around us had food, except 3 tables. I figured they'd be 4/5 mins late. But nope, we waited there till 7.05 PM and got no food, while there was a table of around 15 people who'd received their second servings by that time. One time, a waiter came to our table with food, we got really excited because we'd been somewhat fasting for an extra 15 minutes, but then the ...waiter went back because that food wasn't for our table; such a tease, innit. At around 7 PM while everyone there was eating their fish and chips and we were sitting with our glass of iced tea, they brought us some really unappetizing, complementary soup. I lost it at that point and asked why they are seating people if they can't make enough food. To which they replied ""Amra chai na kono customer mon kharap koruk."" Bro you aren't serving people food for iftar, I think that's enough for me to ""mon kharap."" So then we left the place, as soon as we get on the lift they say ""Apnader food chole ashche."" As if I'm ever going back. We went to BFC and had super wholesome fried chicken. No ragrets, but f u, The Manhattan FISH MARKET Bangladesh. There was more weird shit before this, of course. I'd asked on Facebook whether or not the restaurant takes reservations, and they'd replied that they don't have any booking system in their outlets. They said that they serve people on a ""first come, first serve"" basis so it'd be best if we show up at least 45 minutes before iftar. I called the number given on your Facebook page and website again today at around 3 pm to check if you really don't take bookings. The cellphone was switched off. So we went to the Dhanmondi outlet at 5 PM today, and they told us they couldn't seat two people because all seats were booked. I told them that whoever manages their social media doesn't know that they take bookings, and if I show up at 5 at a virtually empty restaurant that serves iftar ""first come, first get,"" then I should get a table. Then they found us a table, lol. They took our order for an iftar platter at around 6 pm. After 15 minutes or so, they came to confirm it, and their receipt had the items ""garlic mussels, water"" whereas we'd ordered fish and chips and chicken tenders. We told them that they'd taken a completely wrong order for some reason. I mean, I'd understand if they'd thought we ordered grilled fish instead of fried, but mussels???? What??? But then we got no food at all because MUSSELS KHAIBI NA TOH MANHATTAN FISH MARKET AISOS KEN",Negative
15258,This was my first visit to MFM and my experience was awful. I ordered chicken mussels calamari and for drinks I ordered sunset by the bay and lemongrass cooler. The drinks were so disgusting that we both could not take the second sip of those. The drinks were smelling like cockroach and cough syrup and the chicken was smelly too. The spice in the mussels was not good at all. The only good thing was the fries. I would not recommend this place for anything. We ordered coleslaw which was not served and thank God for that. We had some issues with the bill as well. They should improve the sincerity to their customers.,Negative
15260,Food & service is very good.just make the New place light open good luck,Positive
15262,This place is one of the only two decent seafood restaurants in Dhaka. This one provides a greater value for money and heartier portions. Did you ask for a single saucer of dipping? They'll give you 5 different sauces and an assortment of condiments. Did you ask for the menu? They'll land a 500 page illustrated epic noble of fishes and crustaceans on your table. Don't miss out on their chowder of the day.,Positive

15270,I have been regular customer of MFM. But recently the cooking is degraded. The frying of fries (potato) needs special attention. The quality is so poor that one can compare this with road side stalls. Need to catch up. Capamari fries also need to be beter,Negative

15526,"For the first time, I have ordered two pizzas for home delivery. When they arrived, there was a terrible smell from the chicken one (Mexican Hot). Maybe it was their misplaced extra topping that made it worse as I ordered for extra cheese and not a buck-load of mushrooms. The beef one (Beef Bolognese) had no pepperoni on it. Moreover, the cheese they put felt dry & dusty and the dough felt real hard to swallow. Subpar ingredients, false advertisements ??........ maybe, maybe ... Lesson well learnt. Ramadan is definitely not an apt time to order comfort food. I consider myself simply, unlucky in this gamble.",Negative

The pasta was exquisite, well cooked pasta mixed with few pieces of chicken and sausage with a well balanced sauce and cheese, the crust was crunchy and went quite well with the cream, cheese and other bits as well. Overall the whole thing was a beautiful package of bursting tastes that will explode in your mouth. To me, the food of a restaurant has the highest priority that's why I had to give it 5 stars, if i take their service into consideration, I might have given them 0. Happy fooding all!",Positive

15737,"Last food experience was horrible! I was craving for chicken cashew nut salad & thus ordered this from them, along with a set menu via Hungrynaki. The cashew nut salad which they provide with their set menu is completely different from that of the individual dish. I haven't, in my whole, tasted such disgusting chicken cashew nut salad. It smells like beguni & pakora. They fry extemely thin & mini slices of chicken,(almost invisible), by covering them up with a huge amount of ...besan & flour which is responsible for this weird smell. There was abnormal thick coating in each of the chicken slices. The cashew nut salad which they provide with the set menu atleast contains capicum slices but the individual dish contains onions & cucumber only! Horrible...horrible experience. My craving was being killed by their food & I literally threw it away. They should & must stop cheating people by coating up their meat pieces with unnecessary amount of besan & flour to make them look bigger. I had the same experience with one of their beef items. The quality of their wrapped prawns has deteriorated too. There is too much of noodles & the prawns are incredibly thin & small. & the dish is too try but previously their wrapped prawns were juicy. I used to order from them a lot via Hungrynaki but the last time made me too disappointed with the quality of their dishes & have decided not to order from them anymore since you get only fried besan & flour.",Negative

15836,Hello ! Im from banasree and kind of a frequent customer of baba rafi branch . Last couple of times i had a common problem in this branch. They are not willing to take order as per my choice from the given menu but i had to take the foods what they want due to their manpower or some other reason. Today also the same thing happened . There is a new menu launched Chicken quesadilla and i wanted to order but they are not taking this order as it will take time and i agreed to wait but still they wont coz its not easy for them to make ! My question is why you keep such item on menu when you are not taking the order and have to order as u want when u have a menu?? This is not common for other branch of baba rafi . I want management to look into this and take needed action on this .thanks .,Negative
15838,"It's good actually. The only problem i had was from a new item that i had yesterday. It was Tandoori Burger. It was too hot and spicy but was not mentioned in the description. It tasted really good, but a bit of heads up in the description would have been much better.",Positive
15840,"What’s up with your cost saving techniques? Ac out fans running, one man doing cash, preparation and serving. If you claim to be an international chain but serve like a local street shop. Literally, one guy taking 5 customers orders and the place is just crazy hot without AC. Terrible. Banasree Outlet.",Negative
15842,Ordered the kebab and was really surprised by the quantity of beef and other ingredients. i had to eat half the oily bread and then got the taste of the kebab.

16170,"We had the following (opposite NSU main gate 1 & 2): 1 Beef Burger = 99 Taka. Was pretty good. Loved the buns they use. The patty was good for the price range, despite being doused with a lot of sauce. Also, it is a very messy burger so make sure you get tissues. 2 Chicken Burgers = 198 Taka. The chicken burger is definitely the best item on the menu. Delicious patty which complements the soft sesame buns. They use the same sauces for both the beef and chicken burgers. Howeve...r, the sauce combo tastes much better with the chicken patty. 1 Beef Kebab = 99 Taka. The packaging is nice, the kabab wrap is decent. It is definitely not worth getting this for 99 taka. Also, the beef kebab has star anise in it, so if you don't like the smell of star anise, stay away from it! 1 Chicken Kebab = 99 Taka. Again, the chicken version is much better than the beef version. Still not worth 99 taka IMO. The meat to veggie ratio is waaaay off. They need to put more meat in this to be worth 99 taka. Tastes pretty good though. 1 Mountain Dew = 60 Taka. Regular fountain drink glass (not the tiny ones they give you at KFC or other places). Expensive yes, however it was pretty refreshing. Tasted like proper mountain dew (not some watered down version of it). Recommendations = stick to the chicken burgers. Definitely worth it!",Positive

Beef Burger was juicy and the sauce they used was really nice with a hint of Garlic Im gonna be honest, i had most amount of burgers around dhaka from banani, malibag and mirpur, dhanmondi and 300 feet... Baba rafi beats all in price and taste and with excellent cooked fries! Top quality. Thats why i had two burgers!! N.B- every place we been to, customer service is never satisfactory, but this girl in baba rafi,,,she was kind, explainable and also served with smile where she was wearing hijab and with decency,,,5star for because she did that.

According to them the price did not get updated even though had changed the menu price. I agreed since didn't have much time to order again. Now the rib eye steaks that I ordered cost me 850 each. I received the items on time. The meat was not at all juicy and was so hard that I started to feel fatigue and pain i n my hand to cut. I couldn't finish it neither could my father. The price is excessively high and then you get something like this. I would have walked out if I was served it in the restaurant.

16504,Amazing ifter platter. They give you exactly what they show in the photos and all the items taste delicious �,Positive
16506,If not for anything else I had to come to the page and write a review for the lamb itself..!!

All in all-the place maybe named 'Little Korea' but it has some big bold bang flavours waiting for u.. Will definitely come again�,Positive
16508,"The food is good, service excellent. Salads and starters are tasty. Lambs are juicy but the sea food platter is insufficient. Kimchi was absent, chopsticks and crockeries are poor. Interior has to be improved a lot. The entry steps are risky, please try to reconstruct it properly.",Negative

16560,"1. Awful service. No one greeted or showed us where to sit. One of the waiters failed to fetch us a bottle of water. 2. The food is at best mediocre for the price. They are charging premium price. The service and the quality of the food should really be up to the mark. I'd be happy to change this review if they manage to improve. When you say ""from the founders of Tokyo Express"", it really is hard to cut them some slack.",Negative

16586,"I had my iftar in Paprika yesterday.The taste of the continental iftar platter 3 was good but the food were served way too earlier (even we saw our plates arranged in the kitchen long before they were served) which eventually turned them cold..they should have served or at least should have tried to serve the food hot..the steak, therefore, turned hard to cut. I was even more disappointed with their service as i had booked the seat 1 week ago. I asked the window side seats. ...",Negative
16587,"Their AC is old, second hand, dont work properly and last day water was coming from the AC..i have changed my seat several times due to the hot temp...their service aint that bad but they should take care their customer’s comfort.
